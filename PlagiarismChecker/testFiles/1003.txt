Video and industry data were used to assess the inter-relationships of aggression, 
delivery, coat color, year of birth, number of outs, buckoff percent and score in rodeo 
bulls.  An evaluation of laterality based on observations of how the individual animals 
were loaded into chutes at 11 bull riding events showed 63% left-handed delivery and 
37% right-handed delivery across all observations (n = 525).  There was a similar 
distribution for aggressiveness (based on whether or not the bull charged after the rider 
dismounted) with 64% of bulls being non-aggressive and 36% of bulls being aggressive.   
 Significant linear relationships existed between score and number of outs and 
score and buckoff percentage indicating that experience impacted performance.  The 
correlation between number of outs and buckoff percentage was low to moderate (0.06 
to 0.30), depending upon the subset of data evaluated.  
 The r-square value for the analysis of score among all bulls was 0.14; however, 
the r-square value in the subset of bulls with known sires with more than one son was 
0.68 when sire was included in the model.  Similar increases in r-square values were 
observed for 2006 average score, career average score, buckoff percentage, and career 
iv 
 
buckoff percentage, indicating important genetic influences on these traits and/or their 
component traits. 
 Investigations into the relationship between performance and aggression may 
help bucking stock producers improve the selection criteria they use.  The current trend 
within the industry is for several breeders to breed ‘hot’ or flighty, nervous cattle to 
achieve higher performing offspring.  Given that there was no association between 
aggression and score based on chi-square test, aggression may be removed from the 
criteria for using certain animals for breeding purposes.  Based on results from this 
work, if bucking stock breeders want to make genetic changes in these traits, 
documentation of pedigree information is vital.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The sport of bull riding has become the fastest growing professional sporting 
event in the United States (PBR, 2008) and showcases the combined athletic 
performance of both the bull and the rider.  In addition to expanding to Brazil, Mexico, 
Canada and Australia, these sporting events are now broadcast in over 84 countries.  The 
growing popularity of the sport has not only increased the value of the animals involved 
in this sport, but also the need to accurately identify desired sires and dams.  
Unfortunately, most of the criteria have been based on observations by producers.  There 
are many different hypotheses as to what makes a good “bucker,” however these 
observations have not been subjected to empirical investigation.  
Genetic technology has allowed the American Bucking Bull Inc., the official 
registry for rodeo stock, to implement DNA paternity testing.  Unfortunately, the value 
of this registry is quite limited.  While the paternity test is beneficial in guaranteeing the 
accuracy of the genetics of the animals, it does little in terms of identifying the 
performance ability or the breeding values of these animals.  The registry has been 
useful in tracking pedigrees in a similar way race horse industry tracks pedigrees, with 
the emphasis on pedigrees being the predominant breeding criteria. 
Today’s technology allows both beef and dairy cattle breeders to use semen from 
genetically superior bulls.  Because bulls with higher genetic merit are the most heavily

utilized, breeders receive semen of the greatest Breeding Worth (BW) (Foote, 1999).   
This semen is selected from bulls that have been bred through selective breeding 
experiments and their BW is demonstrated through the production ratios achieved by 
their stock relative to other bulls.  There are no analogous breeding criteria for animal 
behavioral or performance traits such as bucking; however, the same concept could be 
utilized to selectively breed for certain behavioral characteristics.  In order to selectively 
breed cattle for bull riding, an understanding of the factors that influence bucking 
behavior is required. 
 Breeding criteria within the rodeo stock industry are based on observations and 
may not be statistically significant or correlated to performance.  Selection is often based 
on the performance of the bull and the assumption that breeding the best bulls to the best 
cows will result in high-performing offspring.  Analyses of data available on the 
performance of bulls do give some indication of the bull’s merit, which can then be 
compared to other bulls.  This comparison may not be an indication of the BW of the 
bull because many breeders have found that breeding the best bulls to the best cows does 
not always produce good “buckers.”    
 The lack of empirical investigation into selective breeding or progeny testing in 
bucking stock provides no reliable data to show what performance traits are heritable 
and what performance traits result from environmental influences.  It is well established 
that animal behavior is determined through a highly complex interaction between genetic 
and environmental factors (Grandin, 1994).  The task then, is to identify how to 
3 
 
adequately measure the heritability of performance traits and, ultimately, genetic merit in 
bucking bulls. 
 The objectives of the study were: 1) determine relationships between 
temperament and performance, 2) investigate the relationship between coat color and 
temperament, 3) explore the laterality of bulls during their performance and 4), to 
identify the genetic influences of the bucking traits.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
Temperament and Behavior  
 The ability to identify and predict behaviors can have profound effects on the 
entire production system.  Unfortunately, there is difficulty in assessing or quantifying 
temperament for statistical analysis (Schmutz et al., 2001).  There are many factors that 
influence temperament, including genetic background,  environment and the interaction 
of heredity and environment  (Buchenauer, 1999).  Fortunately, the amount of motor 
activity and excitability during handling (Schmutz et al., 2001) have been quantified and 
have proven to be persistent over time (Grandin, 1993).  Also, the level of excitatory or 
inhibitory reactions, level of motor activity, persistent habits, emotionality, alertness and 
several other measurements related to temperament have been correlated to heart rate 
(Schmutz et al., 2001), a measurable physiological response.   
Some animals are cautious and fearful while others are calm and placid.  Boissy 
and Bouissou (1995) stated that “fearfulness is a basic psychological characteristic of the 
individual that predisposes it to perceive and react in a similar manner to a wide range of 
potentially frightening events.”  Fear is the underlying factor determining human/animal 
interaction that is referred to as temperament.  
It has been well documented that temperament has many implications in the beef 
and dairy cattle industries, including effects on average daily gain (ADG), carcass 
quality, performance and overall health.  Burrow and Dillon (1997) and Voisinet et al. 
(1997) have shown cattle with poor temperament are associated with a decreased ADG 
5 
 
and an increased incidence of dark cutting carcasses.  Fell et al. (1999) examined the 
relationship between temperament and immune function and concluded that excitable 
cattle have depressed immune systems compared to calmer cattle. 
While having excitable cattle has many disadvantages for the beef and dairy 
industries, it appears to have a positive effect on rodeo cattle.  Bucking bull producers 
tend to have cows that are considered “hot” or highly excitable.  This is partly based on 
the theory that the “hotter” the dam, the “hotter” the offspring and the more likely it is 
the offspring will buck.  Excitability does not necessarily mean an animal will buck.  
From informal observations and conversations with bucking stock breeders, there are 
some highly excitable animals produced in these production systems that have no 
bucking ability.  Also, there have been some calm bulls, such as the bull Promise Land, 
which appear to be calm and docile even though they are well known bucking bulls.     
An important aspect of environment is the social environment in which animals 
are reared.  In this regard, a difference between intensively managed dairy cattle and 
extensively managed beef cattle may inadvertently affect the temperament analyses 
between these two types of cattle (Schutz and Pajor, 2001).  Rodeo-bred cattle tend to be 
raised under management systems much more similar to beef cattle, and this comparison 
appears to be more applicable to this project.  
 
Evolution of Bucking Behavior 
The predator-avoidance strategies in domestic animals are similar to wild 
animals (Coss, 1991) and may be an explanation for the bucking that occurs in rodeo 
6 
 
bulls.  Although not hypothesized scientifically, the evolutionary cause of bucking may 
have originated as a predation response.  Russell et al. (2000) described Criollo cattle in 
the Sierra Madre region of Mexico and noticed their longevity relative to that of other 
breeds of cattle in that region.  These Criollo cattle are also highly sought after rodeo 
cattle with an annual demand of 40,000 steers.  The Sierra Madre region is described by 
Russell et al. (2000) as having limited forage and steep canyons.  Also present in the 
Sierra Madre region are ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), mountain lions (Puma concolor) 
and jaguars (Panthera onca) (Grigione et al. 2007).  Mountain lions and other large cats 
are known for attacks in mountains and canyons (Shaw, 1980).  It is possible that cattle 
developed a predation response by “bucking” in order to dislodge predators off of their 
backs.  Horses can also show similar bucking behaviors which may be the same type of 
predation response that evolved in feral horse populations.   
 
Maternal Behavior 
While maternal behavior was not directly addressed in this study, maternal 
behavior is an important element that should be considered in future research.  This is 
due, in part, to the long held belief within the bucking bull community that maternal 
influence contributes more to the overall performance of the offspring than the sire.  
Because bucking appears to be a reactionary response rather than a learned behavior the 
maternal influence on behavior could play a role in the reactionary responses.  This 
could provide a more accurate assessment of the heritability of the behavior and assist in 
the selection of sires and dams for breeding purposes.  
7 
 
Beckman et al. (2007) evaluated maternal influence on docility scores in 
Limousin cattle and evaluated its influence on phenotypic variance and heritability. 
Direct heritability estimates were 0.29 ± 0.02 to 0.38 ± 0.03.  The amount of phenotypic 
variation due to maternal influence was found to be 8%.  While the authors concluded 
that the overall applicability of selecting for maternal ability in Limousin cattle was not 
warranted since it was a small contribution in overall behavior, it may still influence 
bucking behavior in rodeo cattle.   
 The most meaningful comparison to bucking bulls in terms of large animals 
would be performance horses.  Race horses and hunter/jumper type horses are bred to 
perform athletic events in a similar manner as bucking bulls.  There are numerous 
advantages to utilizing equine performance studies as a basis for understanding bovine 
performance.  Equine pedigrees have been studied for many centuries (Estes, 1952), and 
the equine industry has developed several different performance measurements and 
quantifications.  Due to the fact that horse racing in America has occurred since at least 
the eighteenth century (Gorn  and Goldstein, 2004) the industry has grown large enough 
to warrant sufficient research on performance.  
One hypothesis previously mentioned among bucking bull producers is the 
theory that the “hotter,” or more excitable the dam is, the better her offspring will 
perform.  This temperament-performance relationship was studied in Thoroughbred 
horses by Estes (1952).  Much like the bucking bull industry, the Thoroughbred industry 
had long held the notion that “‘nervous mares,’ in general, are better broodmares.  That 
is, they are more likely to produce high-class offspring than their more phlegmatic 
8 
 
pasture mates.”  The study was conducted using 50 high-spirited mares and 50 
phlegmatic mares held under comparable environmental differences and bred to 
comparable sires (as based on their average earnings index).  Comparisons were made 
between the two groups of dams in addition to the offspring of the two groups of dams.  
Estes (1952) concluded that the temperament of the dam did not affect the performance 
of the offspring. 
Another study, involving rats, was conducted to measure cross-fostering effects 
of maternal behavior (Broadhurst, 1960).  The study involved two strains of rats that 
were genetically different for reactivity, or nervousness: Maudsley Reactive (MR) and 
Non-Reactive (MNR).  Those lines of rats were bred and the pups were cross-fostered 
with different mothers after birth to identify whether maternal behavior could overcome 
the genetic predisposition for reactivity.  The results showed that the maternal effects 
were not great enough to completely mask the temperamental differences between the 
two lines.  However, maternal effects can affect temperament even if they are not great 
enough to completely change the temperament of a cross-fostered animal.  
 
Coat Color and Temperament 
Bucking bulls come in a wide variety of coat colors.  Varied colors exist more so 
in these type of cattle than in typical cattle “breeds.”  This is due to generations of cattle 
being bred to various breeds, thus creating bucking bulls that are an amalgamation of 
many different breeds.  There are many reasons for this that have been mentioned by 
breeders, including personal preference for unique color patterns, attempts to breed 
9 
 
“rank” cattle by using non-traditional breeds such as British White, Mexican fighting 
bulls, Nellore and Longhorns and selection criteria that are based on behavior rather than 
the desired uniformity that is a goal of the beef cattle industry.   
Relationships between coat color and temperament have been found in several 
species including cats, dogs, mink, rats, foxes, and fallow deer (e.g. Hemmer, 1990; 
Keeler and Moore, 1961; Trut, 1999; Trapezov, 1997).  The relationship between coat 
color and temperament was first described by Keeler and King, in 1942, in a study of the 
coat color-temperament interaction in Norway rats (Keeler and King, 1942).  Five years 
later Keeler expanded on his previous research further exploring the correlation between 
coat color and temperament and concluded that there was, in fact, a relationship between 
the two (Keeler, 1947).  
More recently, Hemmer (1990) and Tozer et al. (2003) have examined coat color 
and temperament.  Hemmer (1990) noted that it was easier to tame light colored fallow 
deer than those with wild-type coloration.  In 2003, Tozer evaluated cows and bulls for 
temperament.  T study contained 51 Angus bull calves at comparable ages and body 
weights and analyzed temperament using the Flight Speed Test (Tozer et al., 2003).  The 
Flight Speed Test is a test of the time it takes an animal to cover 1.7 m after leaving a 
weight scale or stanchion (Burrow et al., 1988).  The 51 bulls were divided between 
black and red bulls, having 28 and 23 bulls respectively.  Tozer et al. (2003) concluded 
that red bulls exited faster than black bulls (1.43 seconds for red and 2.56 seconds for 
black, respectively) and the results reinforced Hemmer’s hypothesis that “coat colour 
and behaviour are connected via a common biochemical synthesis pathway the pigments 
10 
 
determining colour – the melanins and the catecholamine group of neurotransmitters 
forming the basis of the information-processing system” (Hemmer, 1990).    
It appears that coat color does not directly cause a difference in temperament, but 
rather the physiological mechanisms that underlie coat color may be responsible for 
temperament.  There are many hormones and neurotransmitters common in stress 
response which is linked with pigment production.  For instance, dopamine, a 
neurotransmitter, and the hormones adrenaline and noradrenalin have an identical 
biochemical precursor to melanin pigments (Ferry and Zimmerman, 1964).  
Furthermore, Burchill et al. (1986) found that dopamine directly influences the 
production of pigment by binding to receptors in the pigment-producing cells.  
Dopamine also indirectly influences pigment production in an inhibitory function.  By 
inhibiting pituitary melanotropin, or melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), dopamine 
stimulates pigment cells to produce pigment (Tilders and Smelik, 1978).  Consequently, 
a change in coat color may be a byproduct of selection against reactiveness (Keeler, 
1947).  
 
Physiology of Stress 
In all animals, genetic factors predispose animals to react to situations that arouse 
fear ( Davis, 1992; Boissy and Bouissou, 1995); therefore, temperament is partially 
determined by an individual animal’s fearfulness. There are some physical markers 
commonly used in the cattle industry that are associated with certain behavioral traits.  
Casual observations indicate that the most excitable, flighty cattle have a long, slender 
11 
 
body with fine bones (Grandin and Deesing, 1998).  Supporting that observation is a 
study conducted by Lanier and Grandin (2002), in which the relationship between 
temperament and cannon bone measurements indicated that cannon bone length might 
help identify certain temperaments.  The study found steer cannon bone thickness and 
width were related to the speed of exit from the squeeze chute.  Steers with thicker and 
wider bones exited the chute at a walk while those that trotted or ran out of the chute had 
thinner and narrower cannon bones.  Heifers with wider and thicker bones tended to be 
less likely to balk at the head restraint.  Both steers and heifers with larger cannon bones 
were calmer than those with smaller bones. 
 
Laterality  
Bucking bulls have distinct observable laterality preferences in terms of how they 
exit the bucking chute.  The way the bulls leave the chutes is referred to as their 
“delivery,” so they either have a left delivery or a right delivery for each event 
performance.  This is an easily documented side-bias which may lead to a better 
understanding of the neurological functions of the bulls in question and may have 
implications for performance.  The delivery they exit from typically results in them 
turning back, or beginning their spinning, in the same direction.  Most bucking bull 
producers evaluate the bulls out of both deliveries when they are young in order to 
identify which delivery the bull prefers. Once the bull has shown his preference he 
generally is bucked using that delivery side in rodeo events. This delivery style is an 
aspect of laterality in cattle that has not been reported before. 
12 
 
Laterality preference has been shown in almost all vertebrates including fish 
(Bisazza et al., 2000), snakes (Roth, 2003), birds (Rogers, 1996), rodents (Neveu and 
Moya, 1997) and other mammals and humans (Warren, 1980).  Studies have also shown 
that even some invertebrates show left-right lateralization (Halpern et al., 2005).  In 
vertebrates this can be explained by the cerebral hemispheric lateralization in the brain 
leading to expressed side bias (Rogers and Andrews, 2002). The cerebral hemispheres 
are the left and the right hemisphere. The hemispheres work together although each 
serves a separate function.  In terms of emotionality, the left hemisphere, also referred to 
as left brain, has been associated with positive emotional stimuli (Wittling and 
Roschmann, 1993) whereas increased activity in the right hemisphere, or right brain, is 
associated with more negative emotional stimuli (Bogen, 1985). Furthermore, Neveu and 
Moya (1997) suggested that a heightened activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
axis plays a role in right brain stress response by increasing corticosterone levels.  In 
addition to emotionality the left hemisphere is responsible for analytical thinking and 
processing, logic, sequential and linear processing and pattern perception.   
When a side preference is shown the processes are caused by the contralateral 
hemisphere (Dharmaretnam and Rogers, 2005).  This is important to understand because 
when a lateral preference is shown it can easily be determined which cerebral 
hemisphere is active.  It can also assist animal handlers in training or working with the 
animal through the understanding of the mindset of that animal.  For example, studies on 
horse training have been conducted to evaluate learning behavior based on laterality and 
hemispheric dominance (McGreevy and Thomson, 2006).  They concluded in one study 
13 
 
that selection or training may be the cause of the left-leg bias, in which a horse grazes 
with one leg more forward than the other, which may reinforce the interhemispheric 
transfer that occurs in higher mammals.  It is worth noting that this many not necessarily 
be conclusive because of the interhemispheric transfer that occurs when the hemispheres 
of the brain interact with each other to coordinate activity (Berne and Levy, 2008).  
McGreevy and Thomson (2006)  
 Physical laterality in cattle has not been well studied. In dairy cattle laterality for 
stall lying tendencies (Arave and Walters, 1980) was shown.  Arave and Walters 
reported that cows lied on their left side 64.7 + 1.1% of the time and heifers lied on their 
left side 61.8 + 2.7% of the time.  This study actually showed laterality preference based 
on an activity whereas most other studies involving cattle focus on behavioral laterality.  
Another study evaluating laterality for lying found a 56% preference for the left side in 
heifers (Wagnon and Rollins, 1972).   
  Because horses have been more extensively studied for laterality, these studies 
might provide a better comparison to bucking bulls than lying in dairy cattle.  Williams 
and Norrist (2007) evaluated stride pattern in horses for three different traits: lead stride 
pattern preference for trot-to-gallop transition, breaking from the starting gate and 
evaluation of multiple observations from individual horses.  There were three different 
breeds of horse involved in this study including Arabians, Quarter Horses and 
Thoroughbreds.  The authors concluded that 90% of horses in this study had a right 
laterality preference and 10% had a left laterality preference.  
14 
 
 McGreevy and Rogers (2005) studied 106 Thoroughbreds and compared the 
laterality bias in the position of the forelimbs. An olfactory stimulus was then introduced 
to test the nostril preference. The modality and nostril preferences were compared to 
establish whether a brain sidedness expression of behavior occurred. The study found 
that the two laterality preferences were not correlated and the authors suggested that 
“lateralization of the equine brain occurs on at least two levels of neural organization—
sensory and motor” (McGreevy and Rogers 2005). 
 
Influence of the Flank Strap  
 The flank strap is “soft rope that is loosely tied around the bull’s midsection in 
the flank area and slipped onto the bull when it enters the alley to the chute. The slack is 
taken out of it before the ride, but not tied too tight, and the strap is removed 
immediately after the ride” (PBR, 2008). The purpose of the flank rope is to produce an 
annoyance to the bull.  This results in the bull kicking out with their hind legs while 
bucking in an effort to dislodge it.  This kicking action results in a performance that is 
less erratic and provides more consistency for the rider (PBR, 2008).  Contrary to a 
belief among many casual observers of bull riding, the flank strap is not attached to the 
testicles of the bull as this would severely limit the range of motion a bull could achieve 
due to the pain it would cause.   
 While the role of the flank strap is a necessary part of the bull ride, it is highly 
difficult to gauge its influence on the performance of the bull.   It is a fair argument that 
the flank strap can help or hinder the performance of a bull.  A common adage in the 
15 
 
rodeo community is that if a flank strap is too loose the bull will not buck and if it is too 
tight it cannot buck.  This is a self-limiting tool that prevents misuse.  Fortunately, bull 
owners and stock contractors familiar with their stock know the degree of flanking that 
produces the best performance from their bulls.

OBJECTIVES 
 
The overall goal of this study was to determine relationships between animal 
aggressiveness, performance scores, coat color, delivery, and buckoff percentages.  The 
objectives of the study were: 1) determine relationships between temperament and 
performance, 2) investigate the relationship between coat color and temperament, 3) 
explore the laterality of bulls during their performance and 4), to identify the genetic 
influences of the bucking traits.  The goal is to be able to use this information in future 
studies to further identify heritabilities of traits that affect performance of bucking bulls.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 Animals 
  A group of 294 bulls were viewed and videotaped at 11 events and producing a 
total of 525 observations.  The events attended included the Professional Bull Riders, 
Inc. (PBR) and Championship Bull Riders (CBR) sanctioned bull ridings.  These 
organizations were selected because of the quality of bulls being used and the 
accessibility of the records on the individual animals.  These bulls ranged in age from 3 
years to 10 years.  Each rodeo event presented a random group of bulls to video, and 
there was no selection use of animals for this project although some bulls ended up 
competing in multiple events.  All animals were owned by individual contractors. Travel 
times prior to events were unknown, and therefore were not considered in the analyses. 
Additionally, the previous nutrition and management of the bulls were also unknown.  
Video Collection 
 The bulls were video recorded during their normal rodeo performance beginning 
shortly before the bucking gate opened until a few seconds after the rider was bucked 
off.  The video was obtained on a handheld Sanyo digital camcorder, and the files were 
uploaded onto a computer for playback and analysis. The point of view for the 
videotaping varied from event to event due to the inconsistency of the venue.  However, 
most of the video was obtained directly across the arena from the bucking chutes.  The 
video was viewed and information was obtained for the color of the bull, the delivery 
direction and the temperament of the bull.

Rodeo Events Attended  
There were five rodeo events that were attended in order to collect the video for 
this study.  Some of the events were held on multiple days and each day was coded as an 
individual event. Therefore, there were a total of 11 event days in which data collection 
occurred corresponding to: 
Championship Bull Riding (CBR) event in Dallas, TX March 11-12, 2006.  
Professional Bull Rider (PBR) event in Liberty, TX June 19, 2006 
Professional Bull Riding (PBR) event in Albuquerque, NM March 31 & April 1, 
2006 
Professional Bull Riders (PBR) event in Dallas, TX June 25, 2006 
Professional Bull Riders World Final (PBRWF) event in Las Vegas, NV October 
28-November 4, 2006 
Aggression 
Temperament was assessed based on whether or not bulls ‘hooked’ or attempted 
to ‘hook’ the rider after the ride. The term hook refers to a bull trying to attack the rider 
or other men in the arena with their horns.  This is a visible indication of temperament 
that can be recorded and used for analysis.  Due to the large numbers of events and the 
number of bulls used in this study, it was not feasible to evaluate flight speed or other 
individual temperament assessments. There was a score of zero (0) for bulls that did not 
show aggression and a score of one (1) for bulls that did show aggression by hooking or 
attempting to hook the men in the arena. 
 
19 
 
Coat Color 
 The same group of bulls that had been video recorded at the rodeo events was 
assigned to color categories.  There are many color pattern combinations of bulls that 
were not given individual color assignments due to the wide variety of colors presented 
and the difficulty in analyzing so many variables.   The color groups were assigned 
based on the primary color of the animals as follows: red, black, brown, white, yellow, 
spotted, brindle and gray.   
Buckoff   
A rider gets off the bull at some point in each ride. It is considered a “buckoff” if 
the rider gets off the bull before the 8-second buzzer is sounded.  This variable was 
available for all of the events, or outs, for the 2006 rodeo season and the range of outs 
per bull was 1 to 38 for 2006. 
Career Buckoff 
 This is the buckoff percentage of the bull from 2003 to 2008 recorded across all 
events and reported by the officiating sponsor of the event. This allowed a larger sample 
size of animals to be evaluated and a more comprehensive evaluation of the animals 
from all events where there were data recorded.  
Outs 
An out is each time the bull comes out of the chute at a bull riding event.  The 
number of times a bull competed and came out of the chute in 2006 ranged from 1-33 
outs for the animals in this study. 
 
20 
 
Career Outs 
 This represents the total outs a bull has had in his career from 2003-2008.  The 
range of career outs per bull was 1 to 133. 
Laterality 
 Each bull was placed into the chute facing left or facing right. This was 
considered the “delivery” of the bull.  Laterality was determined by the direction of the 
delivery and was categorized as left or right.  The laterality of the bull was based on the 
bulls and was used during the analysis of individual events, 2006 events, and the career 
records of the bulls in the study to investigate brain-sidedness, evaluate the relationship 
of laterality to aggression, score, color and buckoff percentage. 
Animal Pedigree 
Each animal’s pedigree was obtained from breeders when possible.  However, 
additional pedigree information was obtained through computer software from the 
American Bucking Bull Inc. (A.B.B.I.), the official registry of bucking bulls in the 
United States.  This information is based only on the DNA registration information, and, 
therefore known parents were not included in the database if they were not registered 
with the A.B.B.I. (2008)  The bulls containing the missing pedigree information were 
excluded from the datasets DS and DS1 and the sire contribution was not part of the 
statistical analysis for DBG and DAB. 
Animal Year of Birth 
 The year of birth was obtained by a variety of methods.  The first choice was to 
obtain the year of birth from the database from the A.B.B.I. (2008)  The registry does 
21 
 
not require year of birth on all animals if it is not reported.  The year of birth was then 
searched for on the Professional Bull Riders website www.pbrnow.com.  The year of 
birth was also researched through the websites of individual bull owners.   
Score 
This is the standard performance evaluation across events for this project.  A bull 
is scored by four judges at each event with the highest and lowest scores dropped.  The 
scores of the remaining judges are added together to obtain the final bull score.  The bull 
is scored by each judge on a scale of 1 - 25 with 25 being the top score per judge, and 
the final score is out of a total of 50 points.  The judges evaluated the performance of the 
bull based on the following criteria: "speed, power, drop in the front end, kick in the 
back end, direction change and body rolls. A body roll occurs when a bull is in the air 
and kicks either his hind feet or all four feet to the side" (PBR, 2008).   
 The more of these criteria the bull exhibits, the higher the bulls score will be.  
Although scores were recorded at the events by the researcher, they were not used 
directly for this study. This was due to the inconsistency of reporting the bull scores as 
they contributed to the final score the rider received.  The scores that were used were 
from a database online located at www.probullstats.com.  The purpose of this website is 
to provide riders with bull statistics in order to help them prepare for events when they 
know the bull they have drawn. The judges submit official scores to the officiating 
organization which then submit the official scores to ProBullStats.  This gives 
consistency to the scores and because they are the judges’ scores it gives a more accurate 
representation of the bulls’ performance.  
22 
 
Average Score 
This is the average bull score for the year 2006. The average mark reported on 
www.probullstats.com lists the average mark as the mark one judge gives which has a 
maximum value of 25 points. For standardization purposes that score was doubled to 
keep all of the scores out of 50 possible points. 
Career Average Score 
This is the average score for the bull over his career from 2003 to 2008. The 
career average of the scores was used in order to get a larger sample size of outs for the  
bulls to determine the bulls’ consistency.  
 Datasets 
There were 525 total observations for this project consisting of 339 bulls, some 
with multiple observations.  The 525 observations were listed as the dataset DAB.  This 
dataset was further divided into two subgroups DS1, DS and DBG.  DS1 consisted of 
106 observations of 69 bulls and was utilized to examine sire influence among full and 
half-brothers.  The dataset DBG was designed for bulls that competed at multiple events 
that were video tapped and contained 128 bulls.   DS only contained bulls (n = 149) that 
had pedigree information available. This subgroup differed from DBG by not including 
animals that were only represented at one event which DS did. 
Statistical Analysis 
Analysis of variance procedures were used (GLM and MIXED of SAS) to 
determine the contributions of the variables to the performance of the bulls. The GLM 
and MIXED procedures were used to analyze temperament, delivery, coat color, buckoff 
23 
 
percentage and contributions of the sire and dam.  GLM procedures were used to obtain 
R-Square values for each model and to calculate simple means to be compared to the 
least squares means from the MIXED procedure.  Pearson’s correlation coefficients were 
used to determine the association between variables including the relationship between 
temperament and delivery, temperament and coat color, temperament and buckoff 
percent and coat color and buckoff percent.  The chi-square test was utilized to 
determine relationships between pairs of categorical variables in the datasets. 
 There were different statistical models used for each variable to allow for the 
adequate representation of the data to be reflected in the results.  For instance, all models 
contained color and year of birth because those effects were constant across datasets; 
conversely the aggression score was only in statistical models that tested for the effects 
of score for events attended.   For DAB and DBG the sire was excluded from the model 
because a large number of bulls did not have a sire listed.  Conversely, for DS1 and DS 
the sire was put into the model to examine the sire effects. 
The models were also adjusted for the different variables being analyzed and 
these adjustments were applicable across all datasets.  When “score” was being 
analyzed, the model contained the variables temperament, delivery, event, color and year 
of birth.  The analysis of “Average Score” involved all of the data for the bulls in the 
2006 rodeo season and included the regression on buckoff percentage for 2006 and the 
regression on the number of outs for 2006.  Similarly, “Career Average Score” used the 
bulls’ career buckoff percentage and their career outs.  Both of these models required the 
removal of the variables temperament, delivery and event because without having 
24 
 
attended those events, temperament and delivery was not known.  While delivery is 
considered fairly consistent for a bull, this is not guaranteed for each event.  The data 
show at least two bulls that have a different delivery over the course of the events that 
were witnessed.  It would be inappropriate to include delivery except when it was 
verified.  As previously mentioned, the delivery is typically based on the preference of 
the bull.  The same principal applies to temperament.  The bull may end up having a 
consistent temperament score or he may end up showing different behaviors at different 
events. Without being able to verify a consistent temperament it could not be included in 
some of the models.  
 All of the datasets analyzed buckoff percent and career buckoff percent as well.  
When running the levels of significance for all of the datasets, the only variables used in 
these models were year of birth, color and outs, or career outs, respectively.  This fits 
with the above justification for excluding certain variables from the models.  Buckoff 
percent and career buckoff percent were also used in correlation analyses.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
  
The levels of significance (P-values) from analyses of variance for all of the 
datasets as presented.  The first dataset, DAB is shown in Table 1.   When analyzing 
score, the only significant factor was event (P = 0.02).  However, this may be explained 
by different bulls end up competing at different events and therefore the quality of bulls 
may be influencing the results.  This could be analyzed by tracking a group of 
contemporary bulls competing in the same events and comparing the performance 
variation between events.  The average score was influenced by buckoff percent (P = 
0.01) with a regression coefficient of 0.1 ± 0.006 (Table 2), outs (P <.0001) with a 
regression coefficient of 0.07 ± 0.012 (Table 2) and year of birth (P = 0.01).  The R-
Square value for the model was 0.34, indicating that 68% of the variation was not 
accounted for.   
The career average score showed comparable findings to the average score as it 
was influenced by career buckoff percentage (P = 0.01) with a regression coefficient of 
0.03 ± 0.0006 (Table 2), career outs (P <.0001) with a regression of 0.07 ± 0.012 (Table 
2), and year of birth (P = 0.001) respectively.  The R-square value for career average 
score was 0.48 which indicates more variation is accounted for in this trial.   
The 2006 buckoff percentage was influenced by the year of birth (P = 0.02) and 
outs (P = 0.0003), however, the R-square value was only 0.11 which indicated that this 
model did not adequately identify factors that influence the trait.   
26 
 
The career buckoff percentage analysis provided an interesting contrast to the 
2006 buckoff percentage.  Similar to the buckoff percentage model, the career buckoff 
percent was impacted (P <.0001) by career outs; conversely, in the buckoff percentage 
analysis, the year of birth did not impact the buckoff percent (P = 0.22) whereas coat 
color did (P = 0.02).  The year of birth significance may be due to the ability of bulls to 
perform as they age.  The significance of coat color may not be identifiable at a single 
event or even after a year of competing.  It may be significant long term either due to the 
sire contributions, it may be indicative of family line differences or due to longevity of 
the different bulls competing that was not tracked in this project.  The R-square value 
was 0.14 and did not explain variation in the trait to much extent. 
The next dataset, DS1 has its analyses represented in Table 3.  When score was 
analyzed, there were no significant variables; however, the R-square value was 0.68 
indicating that the model accounted for 68% of the differences in the score when sire 
was included.  The average score showed that the only significant effect was outs (P 
<.0001) with a regression coefficient of 0.03 ± 0.003 (Table 2).

This could prove useful information for performance management of the bulls.  The bull 
owner could use this information when planning the event schedules and maximize 
performance by managing the number of outs a bull has each year.  The career average 
score showed that career outs (P <.0001), with a regression coefficient of 0.03 ± 0.006 
(Table 2), and coat color (P = 0.05) were important factors.  The R-square value was 
0.64.  The coat color may be significant because this dataset is examining full- and half-
brothers which reinforces the theory that coat color may be influenced by the family 
lines over and above what is attributable to sires.   None of the variables for buckoff 
percentage were significant; however, the R-square value was 0.74.  The only significant

variable in the career buckoff was color (P = 0.03).  Again, this may be due to the 
relationship between coat color and family lines.  The R-square value for career buckoff 
was 0.69.   It is unclear why there is a discrepancy between average buckoff percentage 
and career buckoff percentage.  All three analyses produced much larger R-square values 
when sire was included in the statistical models.  
 The analyses for DBG (Table 4) produced statistics more similar to the results 
from DAB than it was to DS1.  When analyzing score, the only influential effect was 
event (P = 0.004).  For average score, outs (P = .0002), which had a regression 
coefficient of 0.04 ± 0.011 (Table 2), year of birth (P = 0.0009) and 2006 buckoff 
percentage (P = 0.0003) all impacted the average score.  However, the R-square value 
was 0.35 so even though all of the traits were important factors in the average score, the 
model does not account for 65% of the variance.  The R-square value increased when 
career average score was analyzed to 0.54 and represents a larger amount of variation 
that is explained in this model.  All of the variables in career average score were 
significant with career buckoff percentage (P = 0.005), career outs (P <.0001), coat color 
(P = 0.03) and year of birth (P <.0001) respectively.  This dataset included bulls that had 
competed in at least two events, so repeatability across bulls may be influential more so 
here than the dataset DAB.  When examining the buckoff percentages nearly all 
variables were significant for both buckoff percentage and career buckoff percentage.

The dataset DS was analyzed (Table5) and the results closely resembled the 
results for the dataset DAB (Table 1).  The variables tested in the score analysis were not 
significant; however, there was a trend (P = .07) toward event effect. This is probably 
explained, as mentioned above, by the differences of bulls or judges at different events.  
The average score was influenced by year of birth (P = 0.02) and outs (P <.0001), and 
had an R-square value of 0.34.  The effect of the year of birth on the average score could 
be an age effect but it could also be due to popular bloodlines at that point in time.  The 
career average score reinforced the results of the average score model described above as 
the effects of outs (P <.0001), year of birth (P = 0.0009) and coat color (P= 0.04) were 
influential.  The buckoff percentage, when analyzed, followed the trend of the previous 
datasets and was impacted by outs (P = 0.03) and year of birth (P = 0.00); however the 
R-square value (0.17) raises questions as to the validity of the model.  Career buckoff 
percentage was influenced by career outs (P <.0001) and coat color (P = 0.05), and a 
year of birth trend (P = 0.07).

The least squares means are presented for color (Table 6), year of birth (Table 7), 
temperament (Table 8) and delivery (Table 9) for information purposes.  Mean 
separations were not performed.   It is important to consider the importance of even the 
slightest increase or decrease in score.  One tenth of a point could mean the difference 
between winning a $100,000 purse and taking second place for $20,000.  The same 
stakes are on the line for the bull riders because the bulls’ score is half of the overall ride 
score which determines how the rider places at the event.

Table 10 provides the P-values from the chi-square tests for two-way factor 
distributions across all of the datasets in this project.  In the dataset DAB relationships 
were between color and delivery (P = 0.03), year of birth and delivery (P = 0.03) and 
between year of birth and temperament (P = 0.06).  The relationship between color and 
delivery may be due to the influence of sire and family lines and a possible heritable 
relationship between sire and delivery.  The relationship between year of birth and 
delivery may indicate a different relationship in older bulls relative to younger bulls.  
The same rationale can be applied to the year of birth and temperament.  Possibly, the 
older a bull gets the less aggressive he may become due to his acclimation to 
performing.

The DS dataset did not show as much significance in the relationships among 
traits as DAB. This may be due simply to the sample sizes between the two datasets or a 
relationship between year of birth and temperament (P = 0.05) existed, as well as a 
tendency for a relationship between color and delivery (P = 0.10).  The same tendencies 
existed in the dataset DBG with a color and delivery relationship and a year of birth and 
temperament relationship that are both P = 0.07.  In the dataset DS1, color and delivery 
relationship (P = 0.002) was significant while there was a tendency for there to be a 
relationship between year of birth and delivery (P = 0.10).   
Across all datasets there was a relationship between color and delivery.

Three of the datasets showed a tendency for significance for year of birth and 
temperament while three other datasets showed a tendency for significance for year of 
birth and delivery. 
 Table 11 represents the distribution across temperament and delivery 
combinations and was designed to identify whether brain-sidedness could contribute to 
bucking performance which could be useful in developing training methods for the bulls.  
Sire influence was also analyzed to determine whether there could be adequate genetic 
variation that could be exploited in breeding programs.  In the dataset DAB, the 
relationship between temperament and delivery was not significant.  The frequency of 
delivery preference was 62.2% of bulls with a left delivery and 37.8% right delivery.   
There was a distinct manual laterality trait that follows the findings of Arave and 
Walters (1980) in their lying preference study conducted with dairy cattle.  This may 
show that a manual laterality preference in cattle spans across multiple behaviors.  The 
chi-square test showed no difference in distribution of delivery across temperament (P = 
0.77).  None of the other datasets (Table 12, Table 13, Table 14) showed different 
distributions between temperament and delivery.

 The chi-square analysis for color and delivery was also conducted on all datasets.  
There was a tendency across all datasets for a relationship to exist.  For the DAB (Table 
15) the P-value was 0.03 (Table 9).  This represents the largest dataset in the project.  
Table 16 is from the dataset DS and had a P- value of 0.10 (Table 9).  Although it is not 
statistically significant there is a very interesting trend.   The dataset DBG (Table 17) 
also trended to significance (P = 0.07) Table 9.   However, the dataset DS1 (Table 18) 
had a P-value of 0.00 (Table 10).  This could be due to the family lines and the genetic 
influence of both color and possibly of delivery preference. 
 Tables 19, 20, 21 and 22 represent the frequency tables for year of birth 
and delivery for all of the datasets.  Three of the models, DAB, DBG and DS1 all 
showed either impact for a relationship or a trend towards influence with chi-square test 
P-values of 0.03, 0.04 and 0.10 respectively (Table 9).  Alternatively, in the dataset DS 
the chi-square test had a P-value of 0.19.

The relationship between color and temperament did not contribute to the evidence 
provided by Hemmer (1990) and Tozer et al. (2003) in establishing a relationship 
between coat color and aggression.  In all datasets (Table 23, Table 24, Table 25 and 
Table 26) the chi-square test was not significant.  It is possible that with a larger sample 
size or more structured data set, a relationship, if it exists, could be established.

Table 31 Pearson’s Correlation Coefficients involving buckoff and number of outs across all datasets  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Pearson’s Correlation Coefficients between buckoff (both for 2006 and 
career average) and outs (and career outs) were calculated for all of the datasets in order 
to explore whether there was any relationship between those variables.  The dataset 
DAB (Table 31) showed that the relationship between buckoff and outs and career 
buckoff and career outs was strongly associated (P<.0001) but they were not highly 
related (correlation coefficients of 0.21 and 0.27, respectively).  The dataset DS showed 
a relationship between buckoff percentage and outs (P = 0.10) but there was still not 
enough of a relationship to be considered an effect.  There was a significant correlation 
between career buckoff percent and career outs but they do not influence each other.  In 
DBG the buckoff percentage and outs were not related in this data; however, the career 
buckoff percent and the career outs was (P <.0001) and although there was a low 
relationship between the two variables, this correlation was the highest of all of the 
datasets with a value of 0.30.  The dataset DS1 was not significant.

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS 
 
 There are many other factors not listed above that may be contributing to the 
performance of the bulls including the flank strap, travel time to the events, nutrition, 
arena flooring, for example, that also contributes to the score and may also contribute to 
the buckoff percentage of a bull.  This project did not address many of these other 
contribution due to the difficulty of getting measurements and obtaining the information.  
It would also require a series of trials in order to establish repeatability and to identify 
ideal pressures of the flank strap.   
Aggression 
 When calculating temperament it became a question of how to accurately 
represent temperament given the constraints at rodeo events.  To begin with, these bulls 
were videotaped after traveling, sometimes a few miles and sometimes across the 
country.  Different bulls at the same event could have completely inconsistent travel 
experiences which could cause altered behavior.  Alternatively, bulls with more 
experience appear to travel better, though further research on travel time and 
performance should be undertaken, and therefore are expected to have more consistent 
performances.  Additionally, it was not feasible to conduct normal temperament tests, 
such as the Flight Speed Test, since the bulls were performing during the data collection.  
Had flight speed scores been collected prior to bucking it could have negatively affected 
the performance of the bull.  Conversely, had the bulls been scored after their 
performance it could have been skewed by the event.  Therefore, the decision was made 
59 
 
to view temperament when they were performing to get a consistent reading across 
multiple events.  
Laterality 
 The results were as expected based on previous studies conducted on laterality.  
Further research should be conducted in order to more accurately determine whether 
there is a stronger correlation between delivery and temperament.  The sample size and 
the type of temperament scoring system used in this study may not have accurately 
represented the relationships between brain-sidedness and performance.  The learning 
ability may correlate to bucking ability or consistency which could prove important in 
breeding selection and training methods.  This may be established by understanding if 
the bull is left or right brained and therefore, training may be able to be adjusted to 
learning ability.   
Pedigree Information  
The information that was available limited the ability of this study to fully  
analyze the significance of the sires and dams.  The registry provided by the A.B.B.I. 
(2008) was lacking in not only pedigree information, but also the accessibility of the 
information.  This needs to be improved for future research to adequately represent the 
animals being studied. 
 There were observed characteristics such as year of birth and coat color that 
contributed to the performance, or score, of the bucking bulls in this study.  The 
aggressiveness of a bull did not appear to affect the score one way or another.  However,  
60 
 
the aggression appeared to have a relationship with the year of birth (age) of the bulls 
according to the chi-square test.   This information may be useful to producers who 
select sires and dams based on aggression believing the more aggressive bulls perform 
better than less aggressive bulls.   
 The number of outs a bull had, whether in a year or over a career, showed an 
influence on the score.  This may be due to the fact that the better bulls end up 
competing at different events and therefore have higher scores.  However, there may, in 
fact, be a point of diminishing returns on not bucking a bull enough or bucking a bull too 
much.  That was not evaluated in this project but future studies may prove this 
possibility beneficial to producers and stock contractors in their overall bull 
management.    
 The buckoff percent was influential in the score but this may actually be a 
byproduct of the score to begin with.  The judging criteria do not consider buckoff to be 
actual criteria for the score, but rather, it may be the culmination of the criteria: spin, 
direction change, speed, power and drop (PBR, 2008).  If a bull were to show power, 
speed and direction change it would increase his score but also make it harder for the 
rider to stay on, which is likely to result in a buckoff.  Therefore, bulls with higher 
scores may tend to have more buckoffs because they are meeting the judging criteria and 
making the ride more difficult for the bull rider.  
 Delivery played an important role in the project.  There was no association 
between delivery and temperament so the role of brain-sidedness was not established.  
61 
 
However, there were interesting relationships between delivery and coat color and 
delivery and year of birth which should be further explored. 
 When sires were added to the analyses it appeared that sire influenced many of 
the traits associated with score as evidenced by the increased R-square values.  These 
traits are likely heritable, which would prove useful in the establishment of breeding 
values or EPDs.  The effect of pedigree may have been further established had the 
pedigree information been available for use in the study.  Evidence appears to be 
adequate to justify documenting pedigrees for bucking stock breeding animals.  
However, further research should be conducted to identify the heritabilities of the traits 
associated with bucking performance.
