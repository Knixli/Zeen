ABSTRACT 
 
 
Water scarcity and severe environmental degradation are causing water managers 
in Central Asia to reevaluate irrigation water use.    The objective of this research was to 
investigate cropping systems that could improve food security in rural areas of the 
Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan given the constraints of limited water, increasing 
salinization of land resources and a rigid state order system which requires farmers to 
produce cotton and wheat.  Growing short season food legumes after winter wheat 
harvest using alternate furrow and regulated deficit irrigation is proposed. 
Increasing water use efficiency (WUE) associated with crop production is a way 
for arid and semi-arid areas to increase their agricultural production where there is little 
or no prospect for expansion of water resources.  The WUE of common bean (phaseolus 
vulgaris) and green gram (vigna radiata) irrigated with deficit and alternate furrow 
irrigation was evaluated in a field experiment in the Fergana Valley.  The results indicate 
the WUE for both commercial yield and biomass were approximately twice as high for 
green gram as common bean.  Conversely, the water use efficiency for root biomass in 
common bean (0.15 kg m-3) was slightly higher than green gram (0.13 kg m-3).  WUE 
increased in green gram when deficit irrigation or alternate furrow irrigation were 
practiced, whereas it remained constant in common bean for all treatment combinations. 
The different response of the two legumes to regulated deficit irrigation and 
alternate furrow irrigation is explained by examining components of the plant-soil-water 
system.  Both strategies resulted in water savings and reduced crop evaporative 
consumption, with larger reductions in green gram than common bean.  Severely stressed 
common bean extracted more water at 60 cm than non-stressed plants, whereas severely 
stressed green gram used less water at all depths.  Transpiration rates were generally 
lower in green gram than common bean and decreased in both crops as soil water deficit 
increased.  However, after irrigation, common bean’s water use was higher than the non-
stressed treatments while green gram’s transpiration rate only increased slightly from the 
before-irrigation value.  Collectively, these results suggest alternate furrow irrigation and 
deficit irrigation are appropriate methods to increase WUE, allowing application of less 
 
 
i 
irrigation water, particularly, for green gram production.  Use of the FAO’s water stress 
coefficient in predicting evapotranspiration under water limiting conditions appears to 
over-predict water use for green gram and could lead to over-irrigation. 
A greenhouse study was conducted to assess how these crops will respond to soil 
salinity when produced in the gypsiferous soils of the region.  The study evaluated 
various growth components of common bean and green gram irrigated with deficit 
irrigation in soils with and without gypsum and at three levels of soil salinity.  Results 
showed that biomass and leaf area were decreased by approximately 20% for both crops, 
as ECe increased from 2.8 dSm-1 to 7.5 dSm-1.  Yields were higher at all salinities for 
green gram than in common bean.  However, relative yield reductions with increasing 
salinity were greater for green gram (43%) compared to common bean (19 – 31%).  The 
presence of gypsum enabled both crops to maintain reasonable yield at ECe values which 
would be lethal in soils dominated by other salts. 
The CROPGRO model was modified to include a salinity response function.  An 
iterative process was used to modify the CROPGRO code for root water uptake in an 
approach very similar to the empirical reduction functions found in hydrological models.  
This approach has been evaluated in the literature as largely superior to the approach 
found in the current CROPGRO model under conditions of soil salinity.  A qualitative 
analysis of the model indicated the model performed as expected under a range of 
atmospheric, irrigation and crop tolerance scenarios.  Model simulations compared very 
favourably to results obtained in the greenhouse for yield and seasonal ET with values of 
the Willmott agreement index (i) of 0.98  for both variables evaluated at different levels 
of salinity and deficit irrigation (a value of 1.0 indicates perfect agreement).  Final 
biomass predictions were less satisfactory, though the modified model performed as well 
as the original model.  The modified model was successfully tested with field data, on 
common bean from an experiment in the Fergana Valley (i of 0.75 for ET and 0.74 for 
final yield), though the sensitivity of the model to a soil fertility function and relative 
nodule number made it difficult to assess the model performance.

RéSUMé 
 
La pénurie d’eau et la dégradation sévère de l’environnement obligent les 
gestionnaires de l’eau en Asie centrale à réévaluer l’utilisation de l’eau d’irrigation. 
L’objectif de cette recherche était d’examiner des systèmes de production qui pourraient 
améliorer la sécurité alimentaire en milieu rural dans la vallée de Fergana en 
Ouzbékistan, compte tenu des contraintes que posent le manque d’eau, la salinisation 
grandissante des sols et la rigidité d’un régime étatique qui exige la production du coton 
et du blé. Cultiver des légumineuses après une récolte de blé d’hiver en utilisant 
l’irrigation alternante et l’irrigation déficitaire a été proposée. 
Augmenter l’efficacité de l’utilisation en eau (EUE) associée avec la production 
est une fa?on de permettre aux milieux arides et semi-arides d’augmenter leur production 
agricole, là où il y a peu ou pas de perspectives d’expansion des ressources en eau. 
L’EUE du haricot commun (phaseolus vulgaris) et du haricot mung (vigna radiata) avec 
l’irrigation alternante et l’irrigation déficitaire a été évaluée dans une expérience en 
champs dans la Vallée de Fergana.  Les résultats indiquent que l’EUE pour le rendement 
commercial ainsi que pour la biomasse ont été approximativement deux fois plus haute 
pour le haricot mung que pour le haricot commun. Inversement, l’efficacité de 
l’utilisation en eau pour la biomasse racinaire du haricot commun (0.15 kg m-3) était 
légèrement plus haute que pour le haricot mung (0.13 kg m-3). L’EUE a augmentée pour 
le haricot mung lorsque l’irrigation déficitaire ou l’irrigation alternante ont été pratiquées, 
alors qu’elle est restée constante pour le haricot commun pour toutes les combinaisons de 
traitements. 
Les réactions différentes des deux légumineuses face à l’irrigation déficiente et 
l’irrigation alternante s’expliquent en examinant les composés du système plante-sol-eau.  
Les deux stratégies ont eu comme résultats la conservation d’eau et la réduction de la 
consommation d’eau des cultures, avec de plus grandes réductions pour le haricot mung 
que pour le haricot commun.  Le haricot commun plus sévèrement stressé a extrait plus 
d’eau à 60 cm que les plantes non-stressées, alors que le haricot mung sévèrement stressé 
a utilisé moins d’eau à toutes les profondeurs. Les taux de transpiration étaient 
généralement plus bas pour le haricot mung que pour le haricot commun et ont diminué 
 
 
iii 
dans les deux cultures en fonction de l’augmentation du déficit d’eau. Toutefois, après 
l’irrigation, l’utilisation d’eau par le haricot commun stressé était plus grande que les 
traitements non-stressé, alors que le taux de transpiration du haricot mung n’a augmenté 
que légèrement en comparaison avec la valeur avant-irrigation. Collectivement, ces 
résultats suggèrent que l’irrigation alternante et l’irrigation déficitaire sont des méthodes 
appropriés pour accro?tre l’EUE, permettant l’utilisation de moins d’eau d’irrigation, 
particulièrement pour la production du haricot mung. L’utilisation du coefficient de stress 
en eau de la Organisation des nations unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture (FAO) 
pour prédire l’évapotranspiration sous des conditions de limitation en eau semble 
surévaluer l’utilisation d’eau pour le haricot mung et pourrait résulter en une irrigation 
excessive. 
Une étude en serre a été effectuée pour évaluer comment ces cultures réagissent 
face à l’augmentation de la salinité du sol lorsqu’elles sont produites dans les sols riches 
en gypse de la région. L’étude a évalué des composants variés de la croissance du haricot 
commun et du haricot mung irrigués avec l’irrigation déficitaire dans des sols sans gypse 
et à trois niveaux de salinité de sol. Les résultats indiquent que la biomasse et la surface 
du feuillage ont diminuées par approximativement 20% pour les deux cultures, quand 
ECe (salinité) a augmenté de 2.8 dSm-1 à 7.5 dSm-1.  Les rendements étaient plus élevés 
pour le haricot mung à tous les niveaux de en comparaison avec le haricot commun. 
Toutefois, des réductions de rendements relatives avec la salinité croissante étaient plus 
grandes pour le haricot mung (43%) comparé au haricot commun (19 – 31%).  La 
présence de gypse a permis aux deux cultures de maintenir des rendements raisonnables à 
ECe, des valeurs qui pourraient être fatales dans des sols dominés par d’autres sels. 
Le modèle CROPGRO a été modifié pour inclure une fonction de réponse à la 
salinité.  Un processus itératif a été employé pour modifier le code CROPGRO pour 
l’absorption de l’eau par les racines, une approche semblable aux fonctions de réductions 
empiriques trouvées dans des modèles hydrologiques. Cette approche a été évaluée dans 
la littérature comme étant largement supérieure à l’approche trouvée dans le modèle 
courant du CROPGRO.  Une analyse qualitative des modèles a démontré que le modèle 
fonctionne tel qu’attendu sous divers scénarios atmosphérique, d’irrigation et de tolérance 
de la culture.  Des simulations de modèle ont comparé très favorablement aux résultats 
 
 
iv 
obtenus dans le serre pour le rendement et le ET saisonnier avec des valeurs de Willmott 
agreement index of (i) de 0.98  pour les deux variables évaluées à différents niveaux de 
salinité et d’irrigation déficitaire.  Les prédictions de la biomasse finale ont été moins 
satisfaisantes, bien que  le modèle modifié a performé aussi bien que le modèle original. 
Le modèle modifié a été testé avec succès avec les données obtenues avec le haricot 
commun lors d’une experience dans la vallée de Fergana (i de 0.75 pour ET et 0.74 pour 
rendement final), malgré que la sensibilité du modèle à une fonction de fertilité du sol et 
au nombre relatif de nodules aie rendu difficile l’évaluation de la performance du modèle.

CHAPTER 1: GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
 
 
1.1 
BACKGROUND 
 
 
Like many arid and semi-arid regions, drought and water scarcity impact and 
influence many aspects of life in Central Asia.  This is particularly true for Uzbekistan, 
the country located in the middle of the region.  Irrigation is required for almost all 
cropping systems and agricultural production forms the backbone of the country’s 
economy.  As part of the Soviet Union, intensive land and infrastructure development 
during the 1960’s resulted in the rapid doubling of its irrigated area and Uzbekistan 
gained the status as the world’s second largest cotton exporter.  The consequence of this 
development has been extensive land degradation, such as waterlogging and soil salinity, 
due to over irrigation and the drying of the Aral Sea in what is considered one of the most 
serious anthropogenic environmental disasters in history. 
 
The Fergana Valley is one of the main agricultural regions in the country.  The 
region receives only 200 mm of precipitation annually, though its fertile soils and 
continental climate lead to its development as an ancient irrigated oasis.  The Fergana 
Valley is located at the base of the Tian Shan mountains, which are the source of 
irrigation water via the Syr Darya river.  Cotton and winter wheat, the main crops grown, 
are both irrigated using furrow irrigation.  Secondary soil salinization in the Fergana 
Valley is widespread and increasing as the water table rises to within 1 to 5 m of the soil 
surface due to heavy leaching and old, poorly functioning drainage systems (EC-IFAS, 
1999). The population in the Valley is largely rural and employed in agriculture.  
Unemployment rates are high and food insecurity has increased markedly in recent years.  
The rapidly growing population is expected to increase demands on water resources. 
 
The improvement of on-farm irrigation systems and the introduction of low cost, 
water saving irrigation technologies are identified as key and realistic components of 
reducing agriculture’s water demand (Horst et al., 2005).  Deficit irrigation and alternate 
furrow irrigation are two irrigation strategies that are relatively easy to adopt and enable 
water savings.  To increase food production, short season grain legumes, such as green 
gram (Vigna radiata (L.)) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), can be grown after 
 
 
3 
winter wheat harvest.  However, adopting new technologies and changing established 
cropping patterns represents a risk not many farmers in the region can afford.  As farmers 
are required to produce cotton and wheat, any food crops they grow must use scarce 
additional water and increase cropping intensity.  Finally, crop sensitivity to soil salinity 
may make some cropping systems unfeasible.  Appropriate crop models offer farmers and 
decision makers a low risk method of evaluating different management scenarios. 
 
1.2 
HYPOTHESIS 
 
 
The first stage of the research involves identifying and testing appropriate water-
conservation irrigation strategies in the Fergana Valley.  Growing the legumes green 
gram and common bean as second crops after the wheat harvest offers farmers the 
possibility to improve both their food security and land productivity, while still fulfilling 
their commitment to produce cotton and wheat.  Optimal irrigation with alternate furrow 
and deficit irrigation can be implemented to grow these legumes with minimal irrigation 
water. 
 
The next phase of this research investigates the crop response of green gram and 
common bean to salinity in gypsiferous soils and the possible interactions of water-
conservation irrigation strategies and soil salinity.  Cotton and wheat are salt tolerant 
(Maas, 1985) and by the time these crops show symptoms of salt stress, the land will 
already be rendered too saline for cultivation of many other crops.  Compiled information 
of crop tolerance to salinity (Tanji and Kielen, 2002; Maas, 1985) is not easily 
transferable to the gypsiferous soils of the region (Szabolcs, 1989).   
 
The next stage of the research is to modify the CROPGRO model to be applicable 
in the Fergana Valley.  Specifically, a crop growth response factor to salinity is 
developed and tested.  The current theory on how non-halophytes respond to salinity is 
considered in two distinct phases (Munns et al., 2000).  The first response is that of water 
stress, as leaf expansion rates are reduced long before ions accumulate to toxic levels in 
cells.  The second stage of the crop response to salinity is leaf death due to the 
accumulation of Na+ and Cl- to toxic levels in cytoplasm..  In gypsiferous soils, calcium 
 
 
4 
moderates the effects of sodium salinity, limiting growth reductions.  As such, the salinity 
response factor developed for CROPGRO acts in a manner analogous to water stress. 
 
1.3 
OBJECTIVES 
 
The goal of this research is to identify alternate cropping systems and irrigation 
strategies for producing food crops optimizing limited water supplies in the Fergana 
Valley of Uzbekistan.  Deficit irrigation and alternate furrow irrigation will be evaluated 
in terms of their water use efficiency, soil water dynamics and crop water requirements 
for common bean and green gram grown as second crops.  The legumes’ response to soil 
salinity and the interaction between these technologies and salinity will be quantified in 
gypsiferous soils.  A salinity response factor will be incorporated into the CROPGRO 
model and the appropriateness of this model to predict growth and water use of common 
bean in the Fergana Valley will be evaluated.  Specifically, the research objectives are: 
 
1. Quantify the water use efficiency, water use and growth response of common 
bean and green gram to deficit and alternate furrow irrigation and propose optimal 
irrigation schedules and strategies for these crops 
2. Compare the patterns of water use of the two crops when irrigated with deficit and 
alternate furrow irrigation. 
3. Evaluate the estimates of ET predicted by the FAO 56 (Allen et al., 1998) 
methodology and the appropriateness of the suggested depletion levels for 
irrigation.  
4. Determine the salinity tolerance thresholds, relative growth reductions and 
relative rates of reduction in water use of common bean and green gram to soil 
salinity dominated by gypsum salts. 
5. Investigate interactions between the use of deficit irrigation techniques and the 
level of soil salinity for sandy loam soils dominated by gypsum salts. 
6. Develop a salinity response factor for incorporation into the CROPGRO model.

SCOPE 
 
The work contained in this thesis is focused on irrigation water management in the 
Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan.  The technologies and cropping systems investigated were 
identified together with research and technical specialists in Uzbekistan.  The 
technologies and cropping systems were field tested over two seasons on a private farm 
in the Fergana Valley and received feedback from members of the local community, 
including farm workers, irrigators, technicians and local heads of government.  Further 
greenhouse and modeling studies were conducted to complement and extend the results 
obtained from field trials in Uzbekistan.  For various logistical reasons, this work was 
conducted in Canada at the Macdonald Campus.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
 
2.1. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 
This review begins by providing background information on irrigation and water 
resources in Uzbekistan.  The scope encompasses the other Central Asian countries to 
provide the geographical, historical and political context.  Subsequently, a review of 
recent scholarship on crop water requirements, crop response to water and salinity stress, 
water saving irrigation technologies, crop models, and soil salinity modeling is presented. 
 
2.2 
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT: IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE IN 
CENTRAL ASIA 
 
 
In Central Asia, the majority of renewable surface water sources are of a 
transboundary nature.  Generally, the countries in which the water originates do not 
coincide with the countries that are the heaviest users.  The resulting situation, difficult 
for any group of nations to resolve, is further complicated by the established patterns and 
priorities of water use and distribution dating to the Soviet Era. 
 
2.2.1 Available water resources 
 
Much of the land area of the five Central Asian Republics forms the drainage 
basin for the Aral Sea (Fig. 2.1) and likewise the main rivers draining into the Aral Sea 
cross national borders.  The total average surface runoff of the basin is 116.9 km3yr-1, of 
which the largest proportions originate in Tajikistan (43.4%) and Kyrgyzstan (24.4%), 
with the remainder coming from Afghanistan and Iran (18.5%), Uzbekistan (9.6%), 
Kazakhstan (2.1%) and Turkmenistan (1.3%) (Micklin, 2000).  Surface water flows to the 
Aral Sea by way of one of two main rivers and is associated with natural variability.  The 
Amu Darya (79.4 km3 yr-1) derives its runoff primarily from the Pamir Mountains in 
Tajikistan and then flows along the Afghanistan – Uzbekistan border, into Turkmenistan 
and finally back into Uzbekistan where it enters into the western portion of the Large 
 
 
7 
Aral Sea (southern end of the former Aral Sea) (Micklin, 2007).  The Syrdarya (37.2 km3 
yr-1) originates in Kyrgyzstan with runoff from Tian Shan mountains and then flows into 
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan where it empties into the Small Aral Sea, or the 
northern section of the former Aral Sea (Severskiy, 2004; Micklin, 2000; Micklin, 2007).  
Total groundwater resources in the basin are estimated to be 43.5 km3 yr-1 (Severskiy, 
2004), while the proportion which is usable and transnational is estimated at 5 km3 yr-1, 
bringing the total available water resources in the basin to 121.9 km3 yr-1 (Micklin, 2000). 
Collectively, the Amudarya and Syrdarya basins contain over 4000 lakes with a total 
storage capacity of 50 km3 (Severskiy, 2004).  The volume of constructed water-storage 
reservoirs is 74 km3, with Tokhtogul (19.5 km3) in Kyrgyzstan and Nurek (10.5 km3) in 
Tajikistan, the largest.  These reservoirs, like most other large structures, are for both 
power generation and irrigation (Severskiy, 2004).  Additionally, return waters such as 
drainage water from irrigated fields and industrial wastes which are discharged into 
surface water bodies are reused, constituting somewhere between 24 km3 yr-1 (Micklin, 
2000) and 32.4 km3 yr-1 (Severskiy, 2004) of available water.  The higher estimate 
includes water discharged into large desert depressions.  These waters are high in 
pollutants and salts, which together result in progressively degraded water and land 
quality downstream.

Water use in the basin is essentially at (or beyond) maximum capacity.  
Uzbekistan is the largest user with withdrawals of 53 km3 yr-1; Turkmenistan (23.1 km3 
yr-1), Tajikistan (12.0 km3 yr-1), Kazakhstan (11.0 km3 yr-1) and Kyrgyzstan (5.1 km3 yr-1) 
all use considerably less  (Severskiy, 2004).  Irrigated agriculture consumes more water 
than any other sector; the percentage of total withdrawals used for irrigation ranges 
between 86% in Tajikistan and 97% in Turkmenistan.  Annual groundwater withdrawals, 
estimated at 11 km3, are used mainly for drinking water in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and 
Uzbekistan and for irrigation in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan (Severskiy, 2004).  Despite 
having fully utilized available water resources, each of the five republics plans to expand 
their irrigated area (Micklin, 2007).  The problems associated with the transboundary 
nature of the two largest rivers in the basin are compounded by a high degree of 
variability in annual runoff and the important fact that when the rivers were first 
developed for large scale extraction, the Central Asian Republics were a part of the 
former Soviet Union, whereas they are presently independent republics (Severskiy, 
2004). 
 
Intensive agriculture has created severe water quality problems in downstream 
reaches of the Syrdarya and Amudarya, as well as in the Aral Sea.  This is a result of the 
reduced water flow in the rivers and into the Aral Sea, which concentrates the salt and 
pesticide loads introduced with drainage water.  Water salinity in the Large Aral Sea 
exceeds 100 g L-1, which is more than three times higher than that of sea water and is 
lethal to all fish, and most other life forms.  The situation is much better, and improving, 
in the Small Aral Sea; salinity levels in 2006 had dropped to 12 g L-1 and the lake again 
supports many fish species (Micklin, 2007). 
 
2.2.1 Agriculture and irrigation 
 
Agriculture forms the backbone of the Uzbek economy.  The country is the world’s 
second largest cotton exporter, after the US.  Cotton exports account for close to 30% of 
the country’s GDP and 60% of its foreign currency income (Kandiyoti, 2003).  
Agriculture employs 45% of the population while the national unemployment rate is 
estimated at close to 25% (CIA World Fact book, 2007).  Finally, much as in Soviet 
 
 
9 
times, farmers have little choice to produce cotton or wheat if they want access to any 
inputs such as chemicals, seed, fuel, machinery or fertilizers.  However, unlike during the 
Soviet era, the government invests little back into the system, leaving farmers with a 
burden they can ill afford or manage. 
 
Water availability limits agricultural production, as total cultivatable land resources 
total 25.4 Mha, but current production of approximately 4.5 Mha requires 115% of 
average annual renewable water resources (Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations, 2007).  Drainage water is typically reused downstream, allowing for 
greater water use than is available.  Additionally, industrial and municipal demand 
currently account for less than 10% of water withdrawals, but are expected to grow with 
population growth. 
 
Serious land degradation such as salinization and waterlogging and large scale 
environmental disasters like the drying of the Aral Sea, which are the direct results of 
irrigation development, limit productivity and societal well-being.  Massive irrigation 
development was undertaken by the former Soviet Union in the 1950’s – 70’s to make 
Uzbekistan an important world cotton producing centre.  Irrigated area doubled to over 
four million hectares by the mid-eighties.  Formerly, small field sizes of less than a 
hectare and crop rotations including alfalfa and fallow, were successful at controlling 
salinity and waterlogging.  These were increasingly replaced by large fields as massive 
collectivization occurred in the 1930’s (Micklin, 2000).  Coupled with the expansion in 
irrigated area was the near complete regulation of both the Amu Darya and Syr Darya 
rivers.  By the early 1980’s years are recorded with no flow reaching the Aral Sea 
(Micklin, 2000).  The drying of the Aral Sea has had severe environmental, economic and 
health impacts on the communities near the sea.  The problems of land salinization and 
rising watertables reduce land productivity and, in the long term, render it unsuitable for 
cultivation.  Inefficient irrigations due to lack of land leveling and flow monitoring, 
heavy leaching water application and old, non-functioning drainage systems accelerate 
the process of land degradation.  Addressing the needed upgrade of all these factors 
would require substantial investment.  A change of cropping systems to one utilizing less 
water-intensive crops is unlikely in the short term due to the country’s economic 
dependence on cotton and wheat production.  The improvement of on-farm irrigation 
 
 
10 
systems and the introduction of low cost water-saving irrigation technologies have been 
identified as key and realistic components of reducing agricultural water demand 
(Dukhovny et al., 2002; Horst et al., 2005). 
 
2.2.2 Food production issues  
 
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, food security has worsened 
in Uzbekistan.  In the period between 1991 and 1993, an estimated 8 % of people were 
undernourished compared to 26 % in 2001 to 2003.  The dramatic increase in food 
deprivation is explained by a negative annual growth rate in food production (-0.2 %) and 
a growing population (+ 1.8 % per annum) (FAO, 2006).  The proportion of the 
population living beneath the poverty line reaches 31% in rural areas and 23 % in urban 
centres.  The current highly regulated and controlled agricultural situation leaves little 
opportunity for farmers to diversify their cropping pattern.  However, growing vegetable 
crops for personal consumption is a possibility if it can be done with relatively few inputs 
and using minimal water.  Legume crops offer this possibility. 
 
2.3 CROP WATER USE 
 
 
Crop water use is governed by two factors, evapotranspiration (ET) and the 
plant’s ability to transport water from soil to atmosphere.  ET is evaporation of water at 
the plant and soil surfaces and constitutes the climatic demand for water, setting the upper 
limit for crop water use.  While climatic factors drive water use, soil water deficit, soil 
water salinity and plant nutrition may prohibit the plant from meeting the climatic 
demand for water, resulting in crop stress.  This review covers the basic physics of ET 
and highlights the state of current research and engineering treatment of the process.  A 
subsequent section presents the case when environmental stresses prevent plants from 
meeting the climatic demand for water.  To begin, the role of water in plants and concepts 
related to water flow (water potential) in the soil – plant – atmosphere continuum are 
presented. 
 
2.3.1 Role of water in plants 
 
 
11 
 
Water is essential to plant life, vital for maintaining the structure and function of 
membranes and enzymes, acting as a solvent for chemical reactions, providing turgor for 
plant growth, and regulating plant temperatures through transpiration (Volkmar and 
Woodbury, 1994).  However, 99% of the water that passes through the plant is lost to the 
atmosphere as water evaporates at the stomata, in the process termed transpiration.  
Closure of the stomata to regulate water loss also restricts CO2 entry into cells for 
photosynthesis. 
 
The water flowing through plants originates in the soil, travels through the roots 
into the xylem and finally into the stomata where it is evaporated into the atmosphere.  
The water potential gradient between soil and atmosphere drives the process from regions 
of high to low potential.  When the soil is wet, between saturation and field capacity, the 
water potential is close to zero, that of free water.  Therefore, for water to enter plants, the 
water potential in roots and leaves must be lower than that of the soil.  Three types of 
forces combine to create the resultant water potential: matric, osmotic and pressure.  In 
leaf cells, pressure and osmotic forces combine to produce the resulting, slightly negative 
water potential; pressure potentials are positive and result in turgor, giving plant cells a 
rigid structure to enable cell growth.  Osmotic potentials are negative due to the high 
concentration of solutes in the cells.  Water travels through the xylem vessels as a liquid 
through the plant.  It is not until it reaches the leaves that it exits into the intracellular 
spaces where it diffuses to the atmosphere through the stomata. 
 
The rate of water loss through the stomata is governed by both the evaporative 
demand of the air, potential ET (discussed in the following section) and stomatal 
regulation in the plant.  The mechanism by which stomata open and close consists of the 
conversion of organic acids into malic acid and hydrogen ions in the guard cells of the 
stomata.  To maintain near neutral pH, the H+ ions are pumped out of the cell and 
potassium ions enter the cell to replace them.  The cell quickly achieves a high 
concentration of solutes that act to lower its osmotic potential and water enters the cell.  
The result is the cells expand and bend, actually opening the entrance way from the 
intracellular spaces and mesophyll to the ambient environment.  The factors which act to 
control stomatal opening in non-water limiting conditions are sunlight (stomata open in 
the morning) and intracellular CO2 concentrations (when the concentration is too high the 
 
 
12 
stomata close and when it is too low they open).  Neither of these has any bearing on 
plant water status; rather they are mechanisms to ensure maximum carbon assimilation 
and photosynthesis.  This is the paradox of stomatal openings; in opening to allow CO2 to 
diffuse in, plants lose large amounts of water through transpiration (Salisbury and Ross, 
1992; Srivastava and Kumar, 1995). 
 
2.3.2 Atmospheric demand: potential evapotranspiration 
 
Evapotranspiration consists of two physical processes: the evaporation of water 
from the soil surface and transpiration from plant leaves.  The proportion of evaporation 
to transpiration varies with plant growth stage and soil water status; evaporation 
dominates before the plant canopy is fully expanded or in the day following a heavy 
irrigation or rainfall (Allen et al., 1998). 
 
Evapotranspiration is the vaporization of liquid water to water vapour; energy is 
required to drive the process.  This energy is the latent heat of vaporization (λ = 2.45 MJ 
kg-1 at 20°C) and is provided primarily by the net radiation (Rn) incident on the Earth’s 
surface (minus the portion of Rn that is used to warm the air (H) and soil (G)).  A very 
small portion of the energy would be from sensible heat transfer from the air to the water 
in the leaves.  The source of Rn is solar radiation (Rs), which constitutes direct and diffuse 
shortwave radiation.  Rs can either be measured directly or estimated from values of 
extraterrestrial radiation (Ra) or cloudless day radiation (Rso) and a measure of how 
cloudy the day is.  Both Ra and Rso values depend on latitude and date and are compiled 
in Jensen et al. (1990).  The entire incident Rs does not get transmitted to the Earth’s 
surface to vaporize water, or warm the air and soil.  Some of Rs is reflected back into the 
atmosphere; the quantity reflected depends on the albedo (α) of the incident surface (for a 
perfect reflector α = 1).  Another portion of Rs is absorbed by gases in the atmosphere, 
which in turn re-emit the radiation at longer wavelengths, thermal radiation (Rb).  
Absorption and emission of radiation is governed by the Stefan Boltzman equation and is 
highly dependent on the temperature of the body emitting or receiving radiation, and on 
properties of the material.  In summary, the energy to vaporize water for ET is the net 
radiation incident at the leaf surface.  This quantity is highly dependent on the amount of 
 
 
13 
incoming solar radiation, leaf temperature and ambient air temperature (Jensen et al., 
1990). 
 
While solar radiation provides the energy to drive ET, for water (liquid or vapour) 
flow to occur, a potential difference must exist between the vapour in the leaf and the 
surrounding atmosphere.  The vapour pressure inside the leaf (ei) must be greater than 
that of the atmosphere outside the leaf (ez).  In practice, ei is very difficult to measure, so 
the concept of reference crop evapotranspiration (presented in the next section) has been 
developed that eliminates the need to measure ei.  With this formulation, it is the vapour 
pressure deficit (VPD) of the atmosphere which is the difference between the saturation 
vapour pressure (es) and the actual vapour pressure (ea) that influences the rate of ET 
(VPD = es – ea).  Both ea and es increase with increasing temperature, but for conditions 
typical of the Fergana Valley es increases more rapidly with the result that VPD increases 
with temperature. 
 
Wind speed (u) is another important factor in determining the rate of ET due to 
the role it plays in removing the water vapour from the air directly surrounding the leaf.  
Thus wind acts to dissipate water vapour which reduces ea, therefore increasing the VPD 
and rate of ET.  However, another effect of wind is to lower leaf temperatures and VPD is 
a function of temperature. 
 
The importance of temperature in determining ET comes from both the role it has in 
determining thermal heat emission and influencing VPD.  Therefore it should not be 
expected that combined increases in temperatures and VPD would be additive; 
temperature is an important determinant of VPD. 
 
2.3.3. Reference crop ET and crop ET 
 
A number of other factors influence the rate of ET, but these are factors related to 
the time of year, elevation and latitude and are constant for a given location and date.  
Also crop properties such as the crop age, height, leaf area, reflectance properties and leaf 
structure influence ET.  To enable ET to be compared across locations and dates, the 
concept of reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) is used.  ETo is the evapotranspiration 
rate from a reference surface that is not short of water (Allen et al., 1998).  As all of the 
properties of the hypothetical crop are specified, ETo estimates can be compared across 
 
 
14 
locations and are considered only a climatic factor.  The reference crop must be uniform, 
dense, amply watered, actively growing and surrounded in all directions by the same crop 
(Allen et al., 2005; Allen et al., 1998).  The FAO defines a recommended reference crop 
as “a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height of 0.12 m, a fixed surface 
resistance of 70 s m-1 and an albedo of 0.23” (Allen et al., 1998).  The Environmental 
and Water Resources Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE – ET) 
Task Committee on Standardized Reference Evapotranspiration propose the use of two 
reference crops in an effort to meet the needs of both farmers and landscapers.  Their 
Standardized Reference Evapotranspiration Equation, Tall (ET re) is the reference ET for 
a tall crop with an approximate height of 0.50 m like full-cover alfalfa (Allen et al., 
2005).  Both the FAO and ASCE – ET0 approaches are based on the same Penman – 
Monteith combination equation (presented in the Estimating ET section) and differ only 
in the constants used to define the reference crops.  The use of the ETo concept implies 
that all weather data used in estimating ETo should be collected over a crop that meets the 
criteria of the specified reference crop.  In practice this is not always possible and Allen 
(2006) offers strategies to assess, and in some cases, adjust weather data collected under 
other conditions. 
 
Maximal crop ET (ETm) for crops other than the reference crops differs from ETo, 
and occurs when soil water, salinity, soil conditions or nutrients do not limit growth.  The 
discrepancy is because of differences in leaf structure, stomatal functioning, leaf area, 
crop height and albedo (Allen et al., 1998; Jensen et al., 1990).  To relate ETm to ETo 
crop coefficients, or ratios of K = ETm /ETo, have been determined over a wide range of 
lysimeter experiments and tabulated (Pruitt, 1991; Wright, 1991; Bhardwaj, 1991).  The 
K values can be transferred between locations, adjusted for frequency of irrigations, since 
the climatic factors controlling ETm are contained in ETo.  The K values can be separated 
into components dealing separately with evaporation (Ke) and transpiration (Kcb), which 
is often appropriate for research (Allen et al., 2005).  Use of the combined K provides 
adequate estimates of ETm for engineers and farmers.

2.3.4 Methods of estimating ET 
 
Accurate predictions of ET are used to access climate change impacts on 
agricultural productivity, irrigation scheduling and water deficits, and examples of the use 
of ET predictions in the literature are extensive (Richter and Semenov, 2005; Yang et al., 
2006; Eitzinger et al., 2003).  Direct measurements of ET are not possible, with the 
exception of plants grown in lysimeters.  However, many approaches exist for estimating 
ET from measured data, with varying levels of difficulty and reliability (Jensen et al., 
1990).  The accuracy of these estimates or measurements is generally compared to values 
obtained in lysimeters, which are used as standards.  For the ET estimates in lysimeters to 
be representative of crops grown in fields, the lysimeters must be sufficiently large and 
deep, filled with the same soil as is found outside it, be surrounded by at least 100 m of 
similar vegetation (i.e. height and roughness) on all sides (Jensen et al., 1990).  However, 
even ET values obtained from lysimeters are prone to measurement error and the 
specifications of the lysimeter can have large effects on the ET estimates (Pruitt, 1991).  
Both the FAO and the ASCE – ET recommend the use of the Penman – Monteith 
combination equation, in their respective forms, together with appropriate crop 
coefficients as the sole (Allen et al., 1998) or standardized (Allen et al., 2005) method for 
estimating ET.  
The combination method for estimating ET refers to the joint use of the energy 
balance and mass transfer/eddy correlation methods.  The approach is to combine the 
energy approach, which estimates the energy needed for evaporation, together with the 
mass transfer equation which describes the mechanism for removing vapour. Penman 
(1948) was the first to use such an approach, and both the FAO and ASCE – ET 
recommended approaches for determining ETo are modifications of his original 
combination equation.  The main difference in the two approaches is that the FAO 
method allows for the direct measurement of Rs or its calculation based on latitude, 
elevation, date of year and the number of sunshine hours (or alternatively a measure of 
the cloudiness).  The ASCE – ET method requires the measurement of Rs with a 
pyranometer (Allen et al., 2005).  Penman’s approach eliminated the need to specify the 
eddy diffusion coefficients and the surface temperature by introducing the concept on a 
reference surface, and included the first aerodynamic resistance term, albeit in the form of 
 
 
16 
an empirical wind function.  Later work by Covey (1959) and Monteith (1965) led to the 
introduction of surface resistance terms in the combination equation which described the 
resistance to vapour diffusion at the leaf level due to stomata (Monteith, 1981). 
 
In a massive comparison of thirteen methods of computing daily ETo, the Penman 
– Monteith equation consistently ranked first in both humid and arid climates.  Data were 
used from 11 sites including: Victoria, Australia; Denmark; Zaire; and Ohio, Idaho, 
Nebraska, New Jersey, Colorado and three sites in California in the U.S.  Datasets were 
from 45 site – year combinations.  Full details of this evaluation are presented in Jensen 
et al. (1990).  It was on the basis on this evaluation that the FAO and ASCE – ET have 
advocated the use of the Penman – Monteith equation as the recommended method of 
computing reference crop evapotranspiration. 
 
2.4 
SOIL SALINITY 
 
Soil salinity limits irrigated agriculture worldwide and roughly one third of all 
irrigated land suffers from some degree of salinity (Kijne et al., 1998).  In general terms, 
a saline soil is a soil in which soluble salts have accumulated to levels that limit 
agricultural productivity, cause environmental damage or decrease its economic value.  A 
sodic soil is one in which the dominant salt is sodium and is associated with degraded soil 
physical properties. Worldwide it is estimated that between 831 Mha (Martinez-Beltran 
and Manzur, 2005) and 955 Mha (Szabolcs, 1989) are affected by soil salinity or sodicity. 
The Asian part of the former Soviet Union (Szabolcs, 1989) contains 15% of the 
world’s total salt affected soils.  Most of the soils in Central Asia are classified as saline, 
with only desert soils suffering from a combination of salinity and sodicity.  Estimates 
from 1985 are that 60% of irrigated soils in Uzbekistan are moderately to strongly salt-
affected with a resulting 30% decrease in production (Glazovskiy, 1991, as cited in 
Ghassemi et al., 1995).  The region’s soils are characterized by the occurrence of 
gypsiferous soils.  The classification convention of soils in the region is based on a 
description of the dominant salt and a measure termed total toxic salts.  It gives a more 
realistic indicator of salinity that would be detrimental to plant productivity than the 
standard measure of electrical conductivity of the saturated soil water extract (ECe) (EC-
 
 
17 
IFAS, 1999).  However, the method requires fairly sophisticated laboratory analysis, is 
time intensive and is not easily comparable with international standards and conventions.  
Efforts to convert to the use of ECe, advocated by the FAO (Rhoades et al., 1999), are 
discussed in Shirokova et al. (2000).  They found good agreement between using a 
conversion factor of 3.6 to convert EC1:1 mixture, readily measured in the field with a 
portable meter, to the standard ECe, which is the international standard requiring 
laboratory determination. 
 
2.4.1. Effect of deficit irrigation on soil salinity 
The effect of deficit irrigation on soil salinity is an important issue that has been 
addressed in a number of modeling studies.  In an instance with subsurface drainage at a 
depth of 2 m, Prathapar and Qureshi (1999) used SWAM93 to determine that a moderate 
level of deficit irrigation (irrigating to 80% of ET) could maintain crop yields and not 
increase soil salinity in semi-arid areas.  However, when irrigation was reduced to 65% of 
ET, soil salinity increased due to capillary rise and the fact that monsoon rains were 
consumed by the crop rather than used for leaching. 
Where no subsurface drainage exists in arid areas with shallow water tables, 
deficit irrigation maintains the water table deeper than for larger irrigations.  However, 
Prathapar and Qureshi (1999), using SWAM93, found that by irrigating to only 65% of 
crop ET, significant capillary rise occurred and salinity increased relative to larger 
irrigations.  Irrigating to 80% of the crop water requirement maintained salinity at the 
same level as full irrigations by keeping the profile wet enough so that rains were used 
for leaching, but did keep the water table at levels intermediate to the full irrigation and 
the drier deficit irrigation strategy.  The simulations were run for only one year.  Longer 
simulation times may have shown that the deficit irrigated land remained productive 
longer by avoiding waterlogging.  Further, other methods of deficit irrigation (Doorenbos 
and Pruitt, 1977) return the soil profile to field capacity after a large soil water depletion 
has been achieved.  These systems afford greater leaching using less water, though the 
crop will have suffered a reduction in transpiration if capillary rise has not been too great.

2.5 
CROP RESPONSE TO WATER DEFICIT AND SALT STRESS 
 
2.5.1. Water stress 
 
Water limiting conditions, if serious enough, can affect almost all aspects of plant 
physiology (Hsiao, 1973).  The following discussion focuses on mild water stress, as 
encountered in agricultural settings, where available soil water is inadequate to meet the 
climatic demand and where water stress is gradually imposed as in the case of soil drying.  
One of the most widely debated issues is whether root signals or leaf water status regulate 
growth (Hsiao et al., 1998; Davies and Zhang, 1991).  Munns et al. (2000) suggests that 
much of the current misunderstanding and confusion is centered on difference in time 
scales and environments in which experiments are conducted. 
 
Plants grow only at night when turgor pressure in cells is a maximum.  The 
internal water pressure of cells causes stretching and is required for growth (Volkmar and 
Woodbury, 1994).  When the vapour pressure deficit between leaves and air is great, as is 
the case in full sunlight, stomata open, transpiration increases, and leaves begin to loose 
turgor.  The loss in turgor is thought to induce abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis in 
chloroplasts, which is subsequently transported to guard cells.  The ABA acts to inhibit 
the influx of K+ ions into the guard cells, which in turn reduces the entrance of water, 
causing stomata to close partially (Srivastava and Arvind, 1995). Therefore, the presence 
of ABA in leaves is associated with closing of stomata, not necessarily in response to a 
soil water deficit, but rather as part of an internal check on stomatal functioning.  In this 
case, water stress is a transient condition that occurs in well watered plants during times 
of high solar radiation and vapour pressure deficit (VPD). 
 
As soil water is depleted by plant consumptive use and the soil dries, the water 
potential difference between the soil and the plant is reduced.  At this point, the first 
change observed is a reduction in cell growth, and slow cell wall and protein synthesis 
(Hsiao, 1973).  The classical view held that decreases in leaf water potential and turgor 
caused reduced leaf elongation rates.  Indeed, Hsiao et al. (1998) have shown that, under 
 
 
19 
conditions of low water status (during transpiration), increased turgor via pressurization 
can increase growth rates in maize leaves.  However, when plant water status was high 
(non-transpiring state) pressurization and increase in turgor had no effect on leaf 
elongation rates.  This suggests a cause other than lowered leaf water status in causing 
reduced growth rates.  
 
In some cases, stomatal conductance was decreased by mild soil water deficit 
before any reduction had occurred in leaf water potential (Jones, 1985).  This realization 
led to experiments in which apple tree roots were split between two pots, with one half 
maintained at a high water content and the other half subjected to drying (Davies and 
Zhang, 1991).  Leaf area expansion, leaf initiation and stomatal conductance were 
reduced though leaf water potential was not affected.  The role of a root sourced chemical 
signal mediating stomatal conductance was confirmed when the dry roots were re-
watered or excised and growth rates were restored.  ABA had been shown to control 
stomatal opening (Jones, 1985; Cowan et al., 1982; Zhang and Davies, 1989) and the split 
root experiments of Davies and Zhang (1991) provided evidence that ABA originating in 
the roots, under conditions of soil drying, was mediating stomatal closure.   
 
Subsequently, much work investigated this hypothesis and, while the general 
concept has been supported by a substantial amount of data, the regulation of stomata is 
now seen as a very complex process.  When leaf water status is not excessively low, 
ABA is required to close stomata.  Stomata on excised ABA-mutant leaves immersed in 
osmotic solutions of up to -1.5 MPa did not close.  However, in regular leaves containing 
ABA, stomata were more sensitive to ABA when leaf water potential was lower (Tardieu 
and Davies, 1992).  This mechanism is thought to mitigate stomatal opening throughout 
the day (open in morning when leaf water potential is high and closed at midday when 
leaf water potential is low due to transpiration), as ABA present in the xylem flow from 
roots would be fairly constant over a day.  Reviews by Sharp (2002) and Wilkinson and 
Davies (2002) highlight the many interactions between different sources of ABA, 
mobilization of ABA from different regions, ethylene, pH and CO2 in what is understood 
to be a highly complex regulatory process.  Lowered leaf water potentials are now seen as 
a consequence of lower rates of stomatal conductance (Davies and Zhang, 1991). 
 
 
20 
 
Reduced leaf water potential can be mediated in plants in a process termed 
osmolyte accumulation (OA), which has been proposed as an adaptive response to soil 
water drying.  The process involves cells accumulating solutes to a concentration that 
causes water flow into cells; turgor and cell function can then be maintained.  However, 
in a review of work on OA, Serraj and Sinclair (2002) find little evidence that OA can 
help to sustain yield levels needed for production agriculture; rather it may be more 
appropriate as a survival technique in wild conditions.  They question the value of 
lowering the leaf water potential to draw in more water, while maintaining stomata open 
to assimilate more CO2, when water is in limited supply.  In a systems analysis using 20 
years of weather simulations, Sinclair and Muchow (2001) found that in no case did 
delaying stomatal closure result in increased yields.  Very little water available to plants 
is held in the soil at the low potentials achieved in OA.  On the other hand, sustained root 
growth due to OA is a good strategy to avoid drought by mining larger soil volumes 
(Serraj and Sinclair, 2002).  Increased rooting depth has been shown to consistently 
increase yield under conditions of drying soil (Sinclair and Muchnow, 2001) and high 
osmotically adjusting lines in wheat have been found to be associated with increased root 
depths (Morgan, 1995). 
 
2.5.2 Salinity stress 
 
Plant response to salinity is now understood to encompass two phenomena: 
immediate water deficit effects on the plant and specific ion toxicity effects that are 
noticeable weeks to months later, after thresholds of specific ions are surpassed in leaf 
tissue (Munns et al., 2000).  Water deficit effects are caused by the osmotic potential as 
perceived by the roots and result in reduced cell elongation rates, with greater reductions 
occurring in the shoot than root cells (Munns and Termaat, 1986).  The reductions in 
growth rates and transpiration rates are proportional to the concentration of external salts, 
while fluxes of Na+ and Cl- in the xylem transpiration stream do not increase at the same 
rate.  Therefore, increased Na+ and Cl- concentrations in leaf cells are likely to be a result 
of inability to compartmentalize the ions in leaf vacuoles and the reduction in leaf 
expansion (Munns and Termaat, 1986).  Additionally, an equivalent reduction in growth 
is observed in rice when osmotica other than salts are used (Yeo et al., 1991).  Munns and 
 
 
21 
colleagues (Munns and Termaat, 1986; Munns, 1988; Munns, 1993) had suggested that 
water relations and turgor were not important in regulating leaf cell elongation rates, but 
rather chemical signaling from the roots was responsible for reduced growth.  However, 
Hsiao et al. (1998) showed that turgor did in fact regulate leaf growth in osmotically 
stressed plants whose leaves had low water potential, as is the case when plants are 
transpiring.  Conversely, when water status was high (i.e. plants were not transpiring at 
night) increased turgor pressure did not increase the leaf elongation rate in salt stressed 
plants.  To resolve the apparent contradiction, Munns et al. (2000) monitored elongation 
rates of salt stressed leaves for a period of days and found that in daylight pressure 
applied to salt stressed plants restored turgor and prevented reductions in expansion.  At 
night, when the plants were not transpiring, they found that turgor maintenance did not 
prevent a decrease in growth rates and in some cases resulted in lower growth rates than 
the salt stressed plants without turgor maintenance, in agreement with the result of Hsiao 
et al (1998).  The regulation of plant response to water or salinity stress is complex and 
probably is controlled by the interaction of cell water status, solute accumulation, cell 
metabolism and growth regulators (Hsiao et al., 1998; Wilkinson and Davies, 2002).  
Hormones from the roots are felt to play an important role in mediation of the response of 
cells to both water and salt stress (Wilkinson and Davies, 2002; Sharp, 2002) 
 
Physiological investigations of the crop response to salinity have typically been 
conducted using solution cultures and adding NaCl to create saline conditions (Savvas et 
al., 2006; Khadri et al., 2006; Bayuelo-Jimenez et al., 2003; Brugnoli and Lauteri, 1991).  
However, this is not realistic of field conditions, particularly in the Fergana Valley where 
(1) calcium salts dominate and (2) the soils are saline and the irrigation water is of  good 
quality.  The presence of Ca2+ both protects the physical integrity of the soil, by 
preventing dispersion, and protects the membranes in roots, of which calcium is a key 
component (Hall, 2001). Calcium is required for root membrane integrity and proper 
function of ion transport systems in the plant (Lauchli and Epstein, 1970).  Salinity 
inhibits Ca2+ uptake, such that many studies investigating NaCl salinity observe calcium 
deficiency symptoms when the Na+/Ca2+ ratio is high (Greenway and Munns, 1980; 
Lynch and Lauchli, 1985; Maas and Grieve, 1987).  Lynch and Lauchli (1985) found that 
salinity reduced Ca2+ concentrations in roots and shoots of barley.  They hypothesize that 
 
 
22 
external NaCl decreases the Ca2+ radial movement from the soil solution into the root 
xylem, based on both field and controlled chamber experiments.  In their field 
experiments, soil Ca2+ content was 22.2 meq L-1, (saturation).  Mass and Grieve (1987) 
found that the ratio of Na+/Ca2+ produced changes in biomass accumulation in maize 
seedlings, when the relative amounts of Na+ and Ca2+ were varied while maintaining a 
constant osmotic potential of -0.4 MPa.  They suggest many studies confuse effects of 
increasing Na+ with high Na+/Ca2+ ratios.  Greenway and Munns (1980) grew beans in 
solution cultures containing 50 mM NaCl and between 0 and 10 mM Ca2+ and reported 
no growth reduction or increased Na+ concentration in the leaves of plants grown on 3 to 
10 mM Ca2+ compared to control plants grown without NaCl.  Above a Na+/Ca2+ ratio of 
17 (3 mM Ca2+), growth was greatly reduced and Na+ leaf concentrations elevated.  
However, common bean is very sensitive to total salt amounts even when the Na+/Ca2+ 
ratio is low (Eaton, 1942). 
 
2.5.3. Nutrient stress 
 
Soil fertility and organic matter content can affect crop water consumption in a 
variety of direct and indirect ways, and the interaction of these effects may be very 
complicated.  Furthermore, a deficiency of a particular nutrient is frequently associated 
with water or salinity stress in depleted soils.  Nonetheless, the following discussion will 
outline the direct (stomatal regulation, osmotic adjustment) and indirect (amount of 
biomass produced or root development) effects of individual plant nutrients or soil 
organic matter on crop water use.  Increased biomass production and root development 
affect the amount of water used by or available to the plant and are influenced by the 
presence or absence of particular nutrients. 
 
Potassium maintains photosynthesis at low water potentials.  Water stress causes 
greater reductions in photosynthesis rates under conditions of potassium deficiency than 
when adequate potassium is available, though supra-optimal potassium levels do not 
totally mitigate reductions in photosynthesis (Ashraf et al., 2001; Sen Gupta et al., 1989).  
The effect is thought to be due to potassium’s role in osmotic adjustment, as high solute 
concentrations in leaves result in higher relative leaf water contents (RWC).  A high 
RWC maintains cell turgor which is needed for various cell functions.  The effects of 
 
 
23 
higher leaf potassium levels on maintaining photosynthesis was found to be independent 
of stomatal control, as stomatal resistance did not change with increasing potassium 
levels in wheat and barley (Ashraf et al., 2001; Sen Gupta et al., 1989).  This result is 
somewhat surprising as stomatal regulation is mediated by pumping potassium into 
(opening) and out of (closing) the guard cells of the stomata.  However, with an adequate 
supply of nutrients, potassium accounts for about 1% of a plant’s dry weight and in such 
large quantities the osmotic effects would be apparent before deficiencies would be 
severe enough to effect stomatal control.  On the other hand, other studies (Losch et al, 
1992) found increased stomatal resistance (decreased transpiration) with increasing levels 
of potassium fertilization for sunflower and barley.  As explained above, they do not 
attribute this to changes in the physiological control of the stomata, but rather to 
morphological changes, such as lower density of stomata and changes in pore size.  They 
postulate that the higher level of potassium nutrition creates a lower osmotic potential 
(more negative due to higher solute concentration) and results in increased turgor and as a 
result increased growth and leaf area index (LAI).  The change in stomatal density is 
thought to be related to the increased LAI and growth rate at higher rates of potassium 
fertilization. 
 
The role of nitrogen on stomatal control is more ambiguous and Ripullone et al. 
(2004) suggest the mechanism of stomatal response to nitrogen availability is not 
understood, which is reflected by the contradictory results of different studies in different 
species.  Increases in water use efficiency with increased nitrogen are generally attributed 
to increases in photosynthesis, as nitrogen is essential for the enzymes (Raven et al., 
2004).  However, Welander and Ottosson (2000) and Livingston et al. (1999) both found 
stomatal conductance increased with enhanced nitrogen leaf levels, though not as much 
as photosynthesis (carbon assimilation) rates.  Given the increase in photosynthesis, 
which has been directly linked to elevated nitrogen levels, the increase in stomatal 
conductance could be simply a response allowing plants to maintain the CO2 
concentration inside the leaf.  Bowmann and Contant (1994) found evidence in alpine 
willow that higher soil nitrogen levels resulted in higher stomatal conductance, 
irrespective of leaf nitrogen levels, leading them to postulate the nitrogen may be 
involved in a root-to-shoot signaling process.  Finally, many studies (e.g. Grassi et al., 
 
 
24 
2002) found no effect of nitrogen level on stomatal conductance.  Clearly, nitrogen will 
have an important influence on the crop water use as it promotes canopy development, 
but its direct impact on leaf transpiration remains unclear. 
 
While insufficient phosphorus levels are associated with lowered water use 
efficiency in plants (Payne et al., 1995; Bruck et al., 2000), the cause is attributed to the 
reduced photosynthetic rates in leaves grown with insufficient phosphorous.  Phosphorus 
is an essential component of membrane lipids, nucleic acids and energy transfer 
molecules.  These studies show that plants deficient in phosphorus used less water, but 
again this is associated with lower biomasses and leaf area indices, not reductions in 
stomatal conduction. 
 
The role of calcium in stomatal control has been investigated (Atkinson, 1991; 
Atkinson et al., 1990) as before stomatal closure due to ABA signaling, calcium levels 
increase in the cytosol of guard cells.  While calcium deficiency in soils is fairly 
uncommon (Salisbury and Ross, 1992), experiments have not found a relationship 
between high soil calcium levels and stomatal regulation (Atkinson, 1991). 
 
Finally, magnesium, sulfur and chlorine function in osmotic adjustment under 
conditions of severe water stress and/or saline soils.  The soil organic matter influences 
the bio-availability of nutrients thereby affecting transpiration. 
 
Transpiration can be affected by nutrient deficiency that affects either lateral or 
primary root development.  Both Pandey et al. (2000) and Eghball and Maranville (1993) 
report reduced water extraction deeper in the soil profile, under water limiting conditions, 
with deficient nitrogen as compared to adequate fertilizer levels.  However, this effect 
may be a result of a reduced transpiration rate in nitrogen stressed plants due to reduced 
biomass production, as discussed in the next section.  In fact, in the review of Lopez-
Bucio et al. (2003) on the role of nutrients in regulating root structure, increased soil 
nitrate was found to decrease primary root elongation, while lateral root density stayed 
relatively constant at different nitrate availabilities.  However, under conditions of very 
low nitrate availability, if one section of the roots is exposed to high nitrate levels, that 
section responds by increasing growth, whereas growth is inhibited in sections grown in 
regions of low nitrate availability.  Lopez-Bucio et al. (2003) postulate this phenomenon 
suggests the global effect of nitrogen sufficiency.  Plants grown in soils with low 
 
 
25 
phosphorus tend to grow long and dense root hairs which increase their ability to absorb 
limited phosphorus sources (Lopez-Bucio et al. 2003); this is not generally thought to be 
a response to water availability.  High soil phosphorous levels increase primary root 
elongation, increasing the soil water reservoir accessible to the root system (Lopez-Bucio 
et al. 2003).  Finally, other elements (sulfur and iron) also affect root growth and 
development. 
 
Lower LAI reduces transpiration water loss.  The relationship between inadequate 
nitrogen and reduced LAI or biomass production is well documented (e.g. Pandey et al., 
2000).  Thus, in conditions of water shortage, lower levels of nitrogen fertilization (40 kg 
ha-1 as opposed to 120 kg ha-1 or 160 kg ha-1) produced better yields as the reduced 
transpiration rate associated with a lower LAI enabled the crop to use the small amount of 
water available more slowly, avoiding or delaying severe dehydration (Pandey et al., 
2000). 
 
2.6 
WATER SAVING IRRIGATION: CONCEPTS AND TECHNOLOGIES 
 
2.6.1 Water use efficiency 
Water use efficiency (WUE), often referred to as water productivity (Pereira et al., 
2002), is the amount of plant material produced per unit of water used.  Increasing WUE 
is a way for arid and semi-arid areas to increase their agricultural production when there 
is little or no prospect for expansion of water resources.  WUE can be decomposed into 
many individual components such as conveyance, farm distribution and storage, 
irrigation application, transpiration, photosynthesis, biomass conversion and yield 
formation water use efficiencies (Hsiao et al., 2007).  An improvement to any one of the 
efficiencies results in an equivalent fractional increase in the overall WUE.  Analytically, 
Hsiao et al. (2007) have shown that for the same fractional increase in WUE, relatively 
greater improvements are needed in the high efficiency elements, as compared to smaller 
improvements in elements with low efficiencies.  A systems approach with careful 
identification of the social, economic and technical constraints and costs for 
improvements illuminates the best way to increase WUE for a given situation. 
 
 
26 
In this review, WUE will be defined as the biomass produced per unit of water 
evapotranspired.  As such, Wallace (2000) indicates that there are two approaches to 
increasing crop WUE.  The first is by adopting technologies that increase the proportion 
of water that is evapotranspired by the crop, as opposed to that lost to drainage, runoff or 
seepage, corresponding to conveyance, farm distribution and storage, irrigation 
application and transpiration efficiencies above.   
The second approach is to increase the crop’s capacity to produce biomass 
(assimilate CO2) and yield per unit of water transpired.  In this second approach, which is 
the focus of much of the literature on crop response to irrigation (Impa et al., 2005; Yu et 
al., 2004; Tsukaguchi et al., 2005), WUE as the biomass produced per unit of water 
transpired.  This corresponds to the photosynthesis and biomass conversion water use 
efficiencies above.  Efforts to improve this quantity focus on manipulations of the plant 
environment to elicit a crop response to regulate stomatal openings to minimize 
transpiration in relation to carbon assimilation.  Theoretically, for a given cultivar, these 
quantities are believed to be fairly conservative under conditions of constant atmospheric 
vapour pressure deficit and CO2 concentration (Steduto et al., 2007; Fereres and Soriano, 
2007).  These authors suggest that little opportunity exists to improve these quantities 
outside of major genetic breakthroughs, and efforts would be better directed at improving 
the engineering and management issues of irrigation to improve WUE.  Passioura (2004) 
adds that, from a farmer’s perspective, increasing the harvest index (ratio of seed yield to 
total biomass) is a practical third approach to increasing WUE. 
 
2.6.2 Regulated deficit irrigation 
Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) is a relatively inexpensive and easy to implement 
water saving irrigation technology.  The strategy involves manipulating the soil water to 
induce the crop’s inherent response to drought conditions (Davies et al., 2002).  In water 
scarce environments, the goal is generally to increase the WUE.  RDI is used in other 
environments, but with different objectives.  For instance, in vineyards the objective is 
typically to retard vegetative growth and influence fruit quality (Loveys et al., 2004).  In 
RDI, the irrigation water requirement is not completely fulfilled, allowing the soil water 
to be depleted beyond a threshold, such that the crop experiences water stress.  The crop 
 
 
27 
response, which may or may not include a reduction in the rate of water use and/or yield 
reductions, depends on the degree of soil drying, the crop characteristics and the timing 
of the water deficit.  It is generally thought that withholding water during the vegetative 
period, as opposed to the flowering or fruit forming stages, has less impact on final yields 
(Loveys et al., 2004).  The water savings associated with RDI are attributed to reductions 
in stomatal conductance, which occurs as a result of the plant roots encountering drying 
soil, and precedes any change in leaf water potential.  Stomatal regulation is thought to be 
mediated by chemical signals originating in the roots and traveling to the guard cells via 
the xylem.  Further, these signals are now thought to involve both abscisic acid (ABA) 
and the alkalization of the xylem flow, associated with soil drying (Loveys et al., 2004; 
Wilkinson, 2004).  While the stomata control both the rates of transpiration and CO2 
entry into the cell, some evidence suggests that initially the reduction in stomatal 
conductance is greater than the concurrent reduction in carbon assimilation.  This results 
in increased instantaneous WUE values (Chaves and Oliveira, 2004).  While some studies 
show that RDI improves WUE on a seasonal basis (Oweis et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 
2000), other investigators have not found consistent evidence that WUE increases with 
deficit irrigation (Garside et al., 1992; Kang et al., 2000c; Lawn, 1982).  Hsiao et al. 
(2007) state that the increase in WUE with RDI is due to increases in application 
efficiency. 
The timing of water stress in RDI and selection of appropriate crop varieties with 
phenologies to match the times of water stress is proposed by many authors as a way to 
optimize production under conditions limited water (Hsiao et al., 2007; Doorenbos and 
Pruitt, 1977; Allen et al., 1998).  One approach is to allow larger soil water depletions at 
the times when the crop is least likely to experience yield reductions and adequate water 
at more sensitive times, typically the vegetative and flowering/pod-filling stages, 
respectively.  Another approach suggested is to select crops with phenologies to match 
the timing of water stress, by choosing crops with early flowering or quick pod-filling.  
Further to this, mild water stress in early stages can accelerate flowering and pod-filling 
stages and result in shorter growing seasons with reduced ET water demand.  To take 
advantage of these techniques requires a good knowledge of the particular variety’s 
phenology and response to water limited conditions.

2.6.3 Alternate furrow irrigation 
 
Alternate furrow irrigation is the field application of partial root drying (PRD).  
PRD is a variation of RDI that generally improves the WUE of crops, for example pot 
grown tomatoes (Davies et al., 2000) and pot grown common bean (Wakrim et al., 2005).  
In many cases, the strategy circumvents the yield losses frequently associated with RDI, 
as in grape (Loveys et al., 2000), soybean (Graterol et al., 1993) and pot and field grown 
maize (Kang et al., 1998; Kang et al., 2000a; Kang et al., 2000b).  PRD involves 
exposing part of the root system to drying soil while maintaining other sections in well 
watered soil, and is most effective when the two sections of roots are alternately exposed 
to wet and dry soil (Kang et al., 1998).  The method is thought to work via a reduction in 
stomatal conductance mediated by a chemical signal generated in the roots when they are 
exposed to drying soil, as in RDI.  This physiological response of the plant, due to 
exposure of some of its roots to drying soil while the plant is kept well hydrated by other 
roots in moist soil, is hypothesized to cause the benefits associated with PRD. 
For furrow irrigation systems, PRD is practiced as alternate furrow irrigation.  The 
water savings associated with the technique are reduction in water use when drying soil is 
detected, reduced evaporation due to fewer irrigated furrows and reductions in the applied 
water as the volume under the dry furrow does not receive water.  Wakrim et al. (2005) 
found the WUE of common bean increased, though with significant yield decreases for 
both RDI and PRD, in a pot experiment, and that there were no differences in yield or 
WUE between the two strategies. 
 
2.7 CROPS 
 
Grain legume crops provide valuable protein for human consumption while 
improving land productivity by their ability to fix nitrogen in association with soil 
bacteria.  They flower and produce seeds in a relatively short time and could be grown 
after winter wheat harvest in Uzbekistan.  This offers farmers the opportunity to grow 
 
 
29 
food or raise income while still conforming to the state order system.  Further, being short 
season crops, they require relatively little water, though many are considered sensitive to 
drought (Allen and Allen, 1981). 
 
2.7.1 Common bean  
 
Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is one of the most important legume crops 
worldwide, has over 500 varieties and is a key component of human diets in many parts 
of the world (Allen and Allen, 1981).  Extensive accounts of the crop are found in the 
literature and a review of the crop is not provided in this thesis.  References to common 
bean’s salinity and water stress sensitivity are provided in those respective sections. 
 
2.7.2 Green gram 
 
Green gram (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek) is an important food legume in India, 
Burma, the Philippines, Pakistan, Iran and neighbouring countries and is receiving 
increasing attention in Australia.  Also referred to as mung bean, it is consumed in a 
variety of forms including seeds, paste, flour, noodles or sprouted as in North America 
and China.  The high protein content (25 %) of the seed, as well as its easy digestibility, 
make it an important food crop in regions where animal consumption is limited by 
cultural or economic factors (Poehlman, 1991). 
 
Green gram is a warm season, short day plant that is sensitive to cold temperatures 
and excessive rainfall or soil moisture levels (Poehlman, 1991).  Development rates to 
flowering and maturity are both hastened by increasing temperature (Lawn, 1979) with 
the rate to flowering increasing as temperatures increase to between 23 and 28°C, 
depending on the cultivar (Aggarwal and Poehlman, 1977).  Conversely, the development 
rates to both flowering and maturity were negatively correlated to photoperiod by roughly 
the same factor as the positive correlation to temperature (Lawn, 1979).  Both the 
photoperiod and temperature effects are widely documented in the literature and green 
gram’s sensitivity to both factors largely restricts its production to latitudes below 40° 
(Poehlman, 1991).  However, it is their combined effect which occurs in the field as 
determined by sowing date and latitude (increasing photoperiod and temperature as 
spring progresses, particularly at temperate latitudes).  The interaction is not well 
 
 
30 
understood and is dependent on cultivar (Aggarwal and Poehlman, 1977).  Muchow et al. 
(1993) found the time from seeding to pod-set was always 42 days for the cultivar King, 
grown at 14° S, when the sowing date changed by as much as 6 weeks.  Minimum 
temperatures were between 19.7 and 22.3°C and maximum temperatures ranged from 
32.1 to 33.5°C.  However, at 27° S latitude, the time to the onset of pod-filling increased 
to 50 days.  This region had lower minimum (18.8°C) and maximum (28.6°C) 
temperatures. 
 
In a study varying sowing dates and latitudes, Muchow et al. (1993) found that, while 
the yields and final above-ground biomass of the cultivar King varied with environmental 
conditions, the relationship between the two was constant.  For the cultivar King, at the 
onset of flowering between 0.47 and 0.53 of the non–pod biomass is allocated to leaf 
tissue, whereas 0.75 to 0.81 of the non–pod nitrogen is located in the leaves (as opposed 
to the stem) (Muchow et al., 1993).  Seed nitrogen content is 4.57 % (Muchow et al., 
1993). 
 
During the progression from pod–filling to maturity, leaf biomass and nitrogen levels 
decreased as they were mobilized for use in pod and seed development.  The decrease in 
both is associated more with reduced LAI than with a decrease in specific leaf nitrogen 
content. Little mobilization of nitrogen, and no carbon mobilization, is observed from 
stems (Muchow et al., 1993).  
 
2.8 
CROP MODELS 
 
 
The past 30 years have seen an explosion in the development and number of crop 
models, as well as papers on crop modeling in the scientific literature.  The earliest 
models were focused on explaining processes such as respiration and photosynthesis (de 
Wit, 1970).  Subsequently, two main approaches to crop models evolved (Brisson et al., 
2006); the Dutch group models (van Ittersum et al., 2003) were largely heuristic and 
focused on crop ecophysiology, whereas the American family of models (CERES, 
Ritchie and Otter, 1985; Ritchie et al., 1998; CROPGRO, Boote et al., 1998a) had a 
strong emphasis on agronomy and production agriculture.  Finally, CropSyst (St?ckle et 
al., 2003) arose from EPIC (Williams et al., 1984) which simulates environmental 
 
 
31 
conditions, including erosion and soil productivity in agroecological ecosystems.  The 
most often cited goals of the models are: to make agronomic research more accessible to 
producers and decisions makers (Jones et al., 2003; van Ittersum et al., 2003), to facilitate 
a systems approach in agricultural research (Jones et al., 2003; St?ckle et al., 2003; van 
Ittersum et al., 2003), to promote cooperation and data sharing between different 
researchers (Jones et al., 2003) and to illuminate areas where current understanding of 
crop physiology is inadequate to describe crop processes (Brisson et al., 2003; van 
Ittersum et al., 2003; Sinclair and Seligman, 1996). 
 
2.8.1 Types, uses and limitations 
 
Crop models exist along a spectrum, being static statistical models at one extreme, 
and dynamic, mechanistic models at the other.  The former predict an output of interest, 
such as yield, in response to an input environmental variable such as water, radiation or 
nutrient availability.  When based on sufficient data, these models provide useful guides 
to the consequence of a particular management decision, while providing no insight into 
the mechanisms or processes involved (Sinclair and Seligman, 2000).  A common 
example of a static model is the crop yield response to water of Doorenbos and Kassam 
(1979).  The review presented here considers dynamic or process-oriented models; 
combinations of mechanistic and semi - empirical models defined by mathematics based 
on physical, biological and chemical laws applicable under a wide range of environments 
and conditions (Poluektov and Topaj, 2001).  These models are very complex and require 
model developers to be specialists in each field encompassed by the model (Poluektov 
and Topaj, 2001). 
 
2.8.2 Model evaluation and measures of agreement 
 
The most basic way to assess the performance of a model is by comparing 
measured observations to the values simulated by the model.  A number of criteria or 
measures exist to quantify how well the observations agree with model predictions.  Four 
commonly implemented measures of agreement are: the root mean squared error 
(RMSE), 
 
 
 
32 
 
 
 
RMSE = ((1/N) N∑i=1(Yi – ?)2)1/2 
 
where Yi is the observed value for situation i, and ? is the value predicted by the model, 
and N is the total number of situations; mean absolute error (MAE),

RMSE is a classical measure, in the same units as the variable of interest, that 
provides a good estimate of the distance between observed and simulated values, as it 
does not compensate for over and under estimation as is the case with simply summing 
differences.  The sum of differences indicates the bias of the model without giving any 
indication of the error present.  MAE, like RMSE, is a good measure of error that does 
not compensate for under and over prediction.  Further, it avoids giving too much 
significance to one large error, like RMSE does, as the differences are not squared.  The 
advantage of the use of RMSE over MAE is that the former can be decomposed into 
different components that help locate the model errors (Wallach, 2006).  For example, the 
square of RMSE can be decomposed into a bias, a term related to the differences in 
standard deviations of the measured and simulated values and a term related to the 
 
 
33 
correlation between the two (Kobayashi and Salam, 2000).  Likewise, Willmott (1981) 
proposes that the square of RMSE be separated into a systematic component and an 
unsystematic component.  EF and index are both normalized measures that enable the 
comparison of different model outputs or datasets (Wallach, 2006).  Both measures take a 
value of 1 when there is perfect agreement between models and reality, while a value of 0 
indicates the model performs only as well as predicting the average of measured values 
(Willmott, 1981; Wallach, 2006). 
 
Clearly, each measure provides different information about the performance of a 
given model and, when used in combination, can provide sound criteria for evaluating 
and improving model performance.  Finally, the use of graphical representations of 
simulated versus measured values, and plots of the residuals as a function of explanatory 
variables, are useful diagnostic tools for modelers and is to be encouraged in scientific 
publications to aid in the readability of modeling papers (Willmott, 1981; Wallach, 2006). 
 
2.8.3 Available crop models 
This section presents an overview of some of the most commonly used dynamic, 
generic models that predict crop growth in response to a range of agronomic inputs.  
Specifically, CropSyst (St?ckle et al., 2003), STICS (Brisson et al., 2003) CROPGRO 
(Boote et al., 1998a; Jones et al., 2003) and APSIM (Keating et al., 2003) are reviewed.  
Other models that are in wide use like AZODYN (Jeuffroy and Recous, 1999); CERES 
(Ritchie and Otter, 1985); SUCROS (van Ittersum et al., 2003); and GOSSYM 
(McKinion et al., 1988), model only winter wheat; cereals; sugar, potato and sunflower; 
and cotton, respectively, and are not included in this review.  The review is organized by 
presenting each model individually; a brief introduction will highlight what makes the 
model unique or especially noteworthy, followed by a discussion of their main modules 
and relevant testing results related to water deficit. 
 
2.8.3.1 CropSyst 
CropSyst (St?ckle et al., 2003) was originally developed to add a process–
oriented crop growth component to EPIC, which predicts the impact of soil erosion on 
land productivity (Williams et al., 1984).  As such, CropSyst has a strong focus on 
 
 
34 
environmental aspects such as prediction of erosion and soil structure, nitrogen and water 
dynamics, and simulates a number of management practices while being much more 
process oriented than EPIC.  CropSyst is one of only two crop models (the other being 
APSIM) to consider groundwater contribution by simulating capillary rise of 
groundwater into the root zone by solving Richard’s equation in two dimensions.  With 
this approach, a salt balance is coupled to the water balance, to assess the effect of 
salinity on crop growth.  Further, the model is responsive to atmospheric CO2 levels, 
making investigations of all aspects of climate change on crop growth feasible.  Finally, 
the authors claim that it has a strong emphasis on good software design and engineering, 
written in C++ to ensure true modularity and runtime efficiency.  If its sensitivity to the 
environment is its strong point, the simplicity of some of the growth processes modeled is 
its weakness, detracting from its potential to enrich the current understanding of crop 
physiology (Brisson et al., 2006). 
 
Crop development is based on thermal time accumulation and does not consider 
the effects of photoperiod.  This limits its usefulness in comparing the effects of different 
locations and sowing dates.  Development is accelerated by water stress (St?ckle et al., 
2003). 
To compute leaf area, CropSyst uses the concept of specific leaf area (SLA), 
defined as leaf area per leaf mass.  In this model SLA is assumed constant across all crop 
ages and stresses, which is a simplification. Through the use of SLA, leaf area is treated 
as a function of biomass production.  Water stress then acts to change the predicted daily 
leaf area production and leaf duration before senescence.  Leaf area is not responsive to 
planting density or nitrogen stress.  Senescence depends on leaf age (St?ckle et al., 2003). 
Daily potential biomass accumulation is determined as the minimum of two 
predictions (St?ckle et al., 2003); the first is based on radiation use efficiency (RUE) and 
the quantity of photosynthically active radiation (PAR) intercepted (Monteith, 1977), 
while the second is based on the concept of WUE, similar to the approach of Tanner and 
Sinclair (1983).  The use of RUE results in a coupling of photosynthesis and respiration, 
and assumes a constant value of RUE; in reality RUE values exhibit great variability 
(St?ckle et al., 2003).  The RUE method allows the effect of CO2 levels to limit biomass 
production.  The WUE approach also takes into account the direct effect of radiation 
 
 
35 
through its role in transpiration, which controls stomatal opening.  The WUE approach is 
appropriate for water limiting conditions, but less so for humid environments where 
transpiration would probably not be affected because of low vapour pressure deficits 
(St?ckle et al., 2003).  The WUE approach is also problematic since it is hard to validate, 
given the high degree of measurement error associated with field level transpiration, as 
opposed to evapotranspiration (ET), estimates (Brisson et al., 2006).  After the daily 
potential biomass estimate is selected, it is further reduced by temperature, water and 
nitrogen stresses.  An error may be introduced when the WUE – based approach is used, 
due to the double role played by nitrogen stress on transpiration (canopy resistance is 
increased, which indirectly reduces photosynthesis) and directly reducing biomass 
accumulation, through a nitrogen stress factor (St?ckle et al., 2003). 
Final yield is a function of total biomass accumulation and harvest index (HI); the 
latter determines the amount of biomass allocated to yield.  HI is a constant that is 
modified by conditions of stress (water and nitrogen) by differing degrees depending on 
the timing of the stress (St?ckle et al., 2003).  CropSyst does not directly simulate carbon 
or nitrogen partitioning to different plant components. 
 
CropSyst solves Richard’s equation in determining the soil moisture content of 
the soil.  The lower boundary conditions can be set as either free drainage or saturated 
(water table) and upper boundary condition can be flux, to represent ET, or saturated, in 
the case of surface irrigation.  The water balance calculations are dependent on the 
specified root zone depth, measurement of which is prone to error.  The progression of 
the rooting depth is tied to leaf area growth and reaches a user specified maximum unless 
water or nitrogen limits growth (St?ckle et al., 2003). 
Potential ET is determined using either the FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998) or 
Priestly-Taylor methods together with a crop coefficient based on crop growth stage, 
height and roughness.  Partitioning of potential ET to transpiration and evaporation is 
performed using an optical analogy and application of Beer’s law (St?ckle et al., 2003); 
this performs somewhat poorly for row crops (Brisson et al., 2006).  Root water uptake 
determines the amount of water actually transpired and depends on the potential 
difference between soil and canopy, root density and climatic demands.  Root water 
uptake is calculated per soil layer to account for capillary rise.  CropSyst accounts for soil 
 
 
36 
salinity by adding an osmotic potential (caused by presence of salts in the soil solution) to 
the matric potential which together sum to the total soil water potential used to solve 
Richard’s equation and a the salinity reduction function of van Genuchten (1987) (Ferrer-
Alegre and Stockle, 1999).  Actual transpiration is used to determine the water stress 
coefficients which reduce both photosynthesis (RUE) and leaf expansion. 
Soil mineral nitrogen is represented in both nitrate and ammonium forms.  
Mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, ammonium sorption, symbotic fixation and 
crop uptake processes are all considered.  Water and nitrogen balance communicate to 
model nitrogen transport and leaching (St?ckle et al., 2003). 
St?ckle et al. (1994, 1997) and Pala et al. (1996) achieved good agreement with 
CROPSYST and observed values of yield and biomass for wheat (Utah, Syria), maize 
(Colorado and France), sorghum (France) and soybean (France) under different levels of 
water availability.   
 
2.8.3.2  
STICS 
STICS (Brisson et al., 2003) is the most generic of the crop models, simulating the 
greatest number and range of crops.  The complexity of the model, if estimated on the 
basis of parameters describing species and cultivars, is less than that of CROPGO.  This 
makes it somewhat less suitable as a crop physiology heuristic tool, while very 
appropriate as a planning tool as many management approaches and environmental 
conditions can be considered for a wide range of crops. 
STICS is the only model to use leaf temperature as a predictor of development.  Leaf 
temperature is used in calculating water deficit effects.  Development is determined on 
two scales; one for vegetative growth, including leaf area and roots and another for 
reproductive organs, which occur independently (Brisson et al., 2003).  The model does 
not consider plant death between germination and emergence. 
Leaf area growth is independent of biomass and is driven only by temperature, 
plant density and crop parameters.  Photosynthesis can be simulated for closed canopies 
using the Beer’s law analogy, or using hedgerow level photosynthesis.  This latter method 
is appropriate for row crops and conditions of incomplete cover.  Crop geometry, row 
spacing and leaf area index (LAI) are all used to estimate the amounts of diffuse and 
 
 
37 
direct radiation arriving at the crop (Brisson et al., 2003).  Leaf senescence depends on 
crop age. 
As in CropSyst, biomass is calculated as a function of RUE (Brisson et al., 2003), 
a concept that results in the coupling of respiration to photosynthesis and determines the 
partitioning of carbon between roots and above ground biomass.  This approach is a 
simplification of reality that rarely holds true, although it is very economical for coding 
parameters (Brisson et al., 2006).  RUE varies with growth stage, temperature and water 
and nitrogen stresses.  CO2 limits RUE allowing climate change simulations. 
STICS handles the production of yield differently for determinate and 
indeterminate crops. For determinate crops, the process is straightforward and similar to 
that used in CropSyst.  The concept of HI is used to determine carbon and nitrogen 
content of grains, with cultivar specific limits on the maximum number of units and unit 
weight as thresholds (Brisson et al., 2003).  This approach is economical in the number of 
parameters required.  The number of grains produced is determined by the growth during 
seed/pod formation stages (legumes) and depends on the cultivar. For indeterminate 
plants, the growth of harvested parts begins between the onset of filling and end of fruit 
setting.  Fruits set per day are proportional to a potential rate, the effective temperature, 
and the source sink ratio (Brisson et al., 2003).  Many aspects of the growth of 
indeterminate plants depend on source - sink ratio.  The source is new assimilates as well 
as reserves.  Reserves are not localized in STICS, but determined from the difference of 
total biomass, and biomass of fruits, LAI, etc.  The fruit sink size is the product of 
number of fruits and growth potential, summed for all compartments of growth, based on 
phenological stage (Brisson et al., 2003).  Fruit number, as opposed to leaf or fruit 
growth, is the first aspect of growth affected by limited photosynthesis, in what the model 
developers refer to as trophic stress. 
Unlike CropSyst, which solves Richard’s equation to simulate water and nutrient 
dynamics in the soil profile, the tipping bucket approach used in STICS can only 
approximate the water content of each soil layer (Brisson et al, 2006).  The root zone, 
which is generally hard to measure experimentally, limits the soil depth considered in the 
water balance.  The soil is characterized by texture, structure, fissures independent of 
horizons, and stones.  For each soil horizon, a maximum infiltration is defined, such that 
 
 
38 
macropores get filled when the soil is above field capacity.  When macropores in a given 
horizon are filled, water will move upwards to fill the micropores in higher horizons 
approximating upward flux (Brisson, 1998).  Drainage depths are calculated using 
Hooghoudt’s equation and a surface runoff factor determines runoff amounts. 
Potential ET is determined using either the FAO 24 or Priestly-Taylor methods 
together with a crop coefficient based on LAI, height and roughness.  Allen et al. (1998) 
concluded that neither of these methods produces ET estimates as accurately as the FAO 
56 Penman – Monteith equation.  The model can calculate the partitioning of ET to soil 
evaporation and plant transpiration based on LAI (or percent ground cover) using either 
the Beer’s law optical analogy or an energy balance.  Partitioning of potential ET to 
transpiration and evaporation using an optical analogy and application of Beer’s law 
performs somewhat poorly for row crops and was the motivation for incorporating the 
energy balance method in both STICS and CROPGRO (Brisson et al., 2006).  Use of the 
energy balance method to determine ET alleviates the error in calculating convection that 
occurs under row canopies. The method considers minimal plant resistance, in terms of 
LAI, radiation and air saturation deficit, and CO2 content and the crop height to estimate 
roughness (Brisson et al., 2003). 
Root growth is responsible for water and nitrogen uptake for the entire root zone 
(Brisson et al., 2003).  Root depth exploration depends on soil temperature and is 
impeded by excessively wet or dry moisture conditions and restrictive soil layers.  The 
end of root growth coincides with that of leaf growth (Brisson et al., 2003).  There are 
two options for determining root density.  With the standard option, root density is set 
such that effective absorption is achieved and is a maximum at the soil surface.  The 
second option is for the case of a low density- profile.  In this situation, growth with 
respect to length is similar to leaf growth and is distributed to each layer according to the 
proportion of roots present in each layer and any restrictive soil conditions.  A root 
density of 0.5 cm cm-3 is the maximum that water or nitrogen uptake can distinguish 
(Brisson et al., 2003). 
As root growth is governs the ability for roots to uptake water, actual transpiration 
is set equal to root water uptake and can be less than potential transpiration when low soil 
water conditions beyond the threshold for maximal stomatal functioning are encountered.  
 
 
39 
Reduced transpiration results in the calculation of two water stress coefficients, which 
reduce both photosynthesis (RUE) and leaf expansion.  The stomatal stress index equals 
the relative transpiration (actual/potential) and affects RUE.  The leaf expansion stress 
index equals the ratio of actual to potential transpiration and drops from a value of one 
when the soil is moist when the actual transpiration drops below the critical potential for 
cell expansion (Brisson, 1998; Brisson et al., 2003). 
Three stress factors affect different aspects of growth in response to soil nitrogen 
levels: a nutrition factor reduces RUE, a leaf growth factor and a factor that influences 
senescence (Brisson et al., 2006; Brisson et al., 2003).  The model accounts for mineral 
and organic nitrogen sources with mineral nitrogen present as both nitrate and 
ammonium.  While only nitrate is leached, plant uptake does not discriminate between 
the two forms.  Nitrogen absorption is the minimum of demand, as determined by 
dilution curves and supply (Brisson et al., 2003).  Mineralization of humus depends on 
soil texture, temperature, moisture, amount of humified nitrogen and organic matter.  
Nitrogen leaching is determined using the concept of nitrogen diffusivity calculated at 
each soil layer by determining the nitrogen concentration in soil water solution.  STICS 
does not consider phosphorus or potassium dynamics or their effect on crop growth.  
Finally, nitrogen fixation for legume crops is set to meet crop demands but limited by 
water stress, presence of nitrate, temperature and water logging (Brisson et al., 2003). 
 
2.8.3.3. 
CROPGRO 
 
CROPGRO (Jones et al., 2003) is considered the most physiologically based 
agronomic model currently available.  CROPGRO began as a legume based crop growth 
model that originated as earlier versions of SOYGRO, PNUTGRO and BEANGRO 
(Hoogenboom et al., 1992).  It is now one of the two primary crop models, the other 
being CERES, in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) 
software package.  DSSAT manages soil, weather, and management and crop databases 
to simulate various agricultural and climatic scenarios over multiple years.  DSSAT can 
simulate 27 different crops and includes the CERES and CROPGRO families of crop 
models, is over 15 years old and has been applied in over 100 countries.  The crop models 
contained in DSSAT are in modular form and comprised of one code for simulating soil 
 
 
40 
water, nitrogen and carbon dynamics.  Crop growth and development are simulated with 
CERES (maize, wheat, rice, barley, sorghum, millet), CROPGRO (soybean, peanut, dry 
bean, chickpea, cowpea, faba bean, velvet bean, tomato), CROPSIM and SUBSTOR 
(potato).  By maintaining separate crop modules within DSSAT, the individual crop 
models can capture more of the species specific physiological differences while 
considering the same soil, climate and management scenarios (Jones et al., 2001; Jones et 
al., 2003).  As such, it can not be considered as generic, like CropSyst or STICS, and the 
following discussion is limited to the CROPGRO model. 
CROPGRO can simulate closed canopies, in which photosynthesis depends on 
LAI and potential ET and is calculated daily, or hedgerow canopies, in which light 
interception for photosynthesis depends on LAI, row orientation and spacing, percent 
shading, crop dimensions and density, and is calculated hourly at the leaf level (Jones et 
al., 2003).  Specific leaf area (SLA) sets the ratio between leaf area and biomass and 
varies with age, water deficit, radiation, temperature and cultivar.  In early development 
stages, until the plant has its first five leaves, the upper limit to leaf area is set by 
temperature.  In later stages, leaf area is sensitive to planting density.  Senescence 
depends on nitrogen status and dynamics in the plant.  This reflects LAI greater 
sensitivity to water and nitrogen stresses than biomass (Jones et al., 2003). 
While the option to use RUE exists, the approach to biomass accumulation, in 
which respiration and leaf level photosynthesis are determined independently, is in 
general much more complex and process oriented than in the models presented 
previously.  The disadvantage of this complexity being the high degree of 
parameterization required and its associated error due to increased model bias (Wallach, 
2006). 
New daily growth is a function of available assimilated carbon, how it is 
partitioned to different trophic levels, and the respiration energy requirement for different 
tissues (Jones et al., 2003).  During the vegetative stages, carbon resources are allocated 
between leaf, stem and roots, dependent on stress and species.  At the onset of the 
reproductive stages, each day different cohorts of flowers, pods and seeds are added and 
compete with vegetative tissues for carbon and nitrogen resources, depending on species, 
water and nitrogen status, and temperature.  For determinate crops, all assimilate is 
 
 
41 
partitioned to reproductive organs, whereas in indeterminate crops, a fraction will still be 
allocated to vegetative growth.  Nitrogen, protein and carbon may all be mobilized from 
leaf tissues and allocated to seeds, causing a decline in photosynthesis due to nitrogen 
stress.  Respiration is a function of photosynthesis, though computed independently, and 
as a function of species parameters (Jones et al., 2003; Boote et al., 1998a; Boote et al., 
1998b). 
CROPGRO employs source-sink relationships to determine the carbon and 
nitrogen content of grains, though many of these relationships are not perfectly 
understood.  Total biomass accumulation during reproductive organ formation determines 
the number of seeds, dependent on cultivar traits. 
A tipping bucket approach is used in CROPGRO and the DSSAT suite of crop 
models to determine water infiltration and soil moisture in successive soil layers.  Water 
drains to the next layer when the soil moisture is above the drained upper limit 
(equivalent to field capacity) or can be simulated as upward flow when the soil is 
saturated in layers below, depending on the soil’s hydraulic conductivity (Ritchie, 1998).  
Many soil – water parameters can be estimated by DSSAT based on soil texture (Ritchie, 
1998).  All water balance calculations are constrained to the user specified root zone 
depth, which is generally error prone due to measurement uncertainties.  The CENTURY 
(Parton et al., 1988) model is included with the DSSAT models to simulate the effects of 
organic surface residues. 
Potential ET is calculated using one of the FAO 24, FAO 56, Priestly-Taylor, or 
hourly energy balance methods in combination with a LAI based crop coefficient, 
incorporating effects of roughness and crop height.  Partitioning of potential ET to 
transpiration and evaporation using an optical analogy and application of Beer’s law is 
generally unsatisfactory for row crops and is improved when the energy balance approach 
is implemented (Brisson et al., 2006). 
Root water uptake is determined per soil layer and depends on root length density, 
soil water content, soil hydraulic conductivity, root diameter and water potential 
difference between soil and roots in an approximation of radial flow to roots (Jones et al., 
2003; Ritchie, 1998).  Actual crop evapotranspiration is determined as the minimum of 
potential crop evapotranspiration and root water uptake.  If root water uptake is less than 
 
 
42 
potential evapotranspiration, stomatal closure is simulated; though experimental evidence 
of (Bourgault, 2008) suggests that the extent of this phenomenon is dependent on species.  
Three water stress factors are computed when the actual transpiration changes in relation 
to potential evapotranspiration.  The water stress factor for reducing photosynthesis acts 
when potential root water uptake is less than potential transpiration (Jones et al., 2003; 
Ritchie, 1998).  A second water stress factor for reducing expansive growth, associated 
with plant turgor, is reduced when potential root water uptake is less than 1.5 times the 
potential transpiration (Jones et al., 2003; Ritchie, 1998).  The third water stress factor 
acts to increase biomass partitioning to the roots when the ratio of actual transpiration to 
potential transpiration is less than 1 (Hoogenboom et al., 1992).  The water stress factors 
affecting above ground growth are similar in CROPGRO and STICS, but only 
CROPGRO simulates root growth response to soil water status. 
 
CROPGRO has been successfully tested in a number of systems and 
environments (Boote et al., 1997; Mavromatis et al., 2001; Singh et al., 1999), but with 
relatively few evaluations of its water balance or ability to simulate water stress.  
Heinemann et al. (2000) obtained good agreement between measured and simulated 
results with CROPGRO investigating the effects of irrigation schedule and duration for 
dry beans irrigated by a  centre pivot system in Brazil.  Nielsen et al. (2002) determined 
that both RQZWM and CROPGRO adequately predicted soybean yield, biomass and LAI 
in response to water deficit in a series of sprinkler, rain-out and drip irrigation 
experiments.  However, the degree of water stress imposed in the experiments is not clear 
and some results seem confounding.  For example, in the sprinkler line source 
experiments, water stress was not imposed until late in the reproductive phase, though 
CROPGRO predicted large reductions in LAI, causing the reductions in ET.  The authors 
point out that stomatal regulation or plant water status would be the reason for reductions 
in ET, though this response was not captured by the model.   
In a comparison of the water uptake algorithms in CropSyst and CERES, in which 
the latter uses the same water balance as CROPGRO, both models performed comparably 
well at predicting water uptake of maize and soil water content under conditions of wet 
and dry soil (Jara and St?ckle, 1999).  While CropSyst is more process oriented, the 
improvement in simulation of water use and soil water content only occurred in the driest 
 
 
43 
conditions and then the relative improvement was very small.  To limit the comparison to 
the water simulation algorithms, field measurements of maximal evapotranspiration, 
using the latent heat flux over a well watered treatment from the Bowen ratio energy 
balance method, leaf area and root fraction in a particular layer (CropSyst) and root 
length density (CERES) were used as inputs to the models.  In actual simulations these 
would also be predicted and the errors in these quantities would propagate to the water 
use simulations (Jara and St?ckle, 1999). 
 
2.8.3.4. 
APSIM 
 
Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) (Keating et al., 2003) is a 
modeling framework designed to simulate yield in response to a number of management 
variables.  APSIM has been developed in Australia and has tried to combine together 
cropping models with environmental models, using a modular, systems approach to make 
predictions about crop and land productivity in the short and long terms.  Much like 
DSSAT, APSIM is the interface for soil, climate and crop models.  Currently, each 
species, or group of species, is simulated in its own model, so that the processes captured 
for different species are not consistent.  Efforts had been made to consolidate models into 
one process based model (Wang et al., 2002), though no literature or public versions are 
available.  None the less, while APSIM is not generic, it is included in this review as it 
models green gram (Robertson et al., 2002), treats an adequate level of physiological 
processes (Keating et al., 2003) and includes a response to soil salinity (Rodriguez et al., 
2006).  The following description is based on APSIM – Legume (Robertson et al., 2002). 
Development in APSIM – Legume is based on thermal time, time within a 
temperature threshold range, with temperature thresholds taken form literature values.  
Development is divided into a number of phenological stages, whose duration is based on 
photothermal time, time with a temperature and photoperiod threshold range, 
accumulation (Robertson et al., 2002).  Initial soil moisture levels affect the time between 
sowing and emergence.  Water, nitrogen and vernalization stresses are considered in 
calculations of development rate, but Robertson et al. (2002) note that the lack of 
literature on evaluating the model with these stresses limits accurate parameterization. 
 
 
44 
Potential leaf area expansion is a function of the rate of leaf appearance, 
determined by node appearance due to photothermal days, and maximum leaf size.  Leaf 
area production is reduced if inadequate carbon supplies are available to meet the daily 
increase in LA, in an approach similar to that found in CROPGRO.  Carbon supply is 
generally limiting at high plant densities (Robertson et al., 2002). 
Potential daily above-ground biomass production depends on LAI, radiation 
interception and a crop specific RUE.  While photosynthesis is not computed using a leaf 
level energy balance, radiation interception is reduced to account for row spacing.  RUE 
is further limited by temperatures of the current and previous days.  Actual daily biomass 
can be limited based on RUE, nitrogen and water stresses.  Biomass is partitioned to six 
different plant parts, depending on the growth stage.  Plant height is used in intercrop 
systems to determine the radiation that arrives at the canopy (Robertson et al., 2002). 
 
Daily increases in HI are used to determine amount of carbon allocated to grains.  
If carbon reserves are inadequate to meet grain requirements, carbon can be translocated 
from leaves and stems, dependent on crop specific limits (Robertson et al., 2002). 
Crop nitrogen demand is set to maintain plant parts at the critical nitrogen level, 
which is crop specific, for the current day’s biomass production, as well as total biomass.  
Crop uptake is by mass flow due to nitrogen in the soil solution, active transport or 
nitrogen fixation.  A parameter sets the amount of nitrogen that will be fixed in the 
presence of mineral nitrogen in the soil.  Nodule growth and nitrogen fixation are limited 
by low soil water conditions (Robertson et al., 2002). 
APSIM simulates the water balance using either a tipping bucket approach or a 
numerical solution of Richard’s equation (Keating et al., 2003).  In the tipping bucket 
approach water infiltration and soil moisture in successive soil layers are calculated based 
on soil properties such as the drained upper limit (equivalent to field capacity), the lower 
limit (analogous to permanent wilting point), hydraulic conductivity and soil texture.  
Water drains to the next layer when the soil moisture is above the drained upper limit or 
can be simulated as upward flow when the soil is saturated in layers below, depending on 
the soil’s hydraulic conductivity (Keating et al., 2003).  Nitrogen or solute movement is 
determined using a mixing algorithm and water flow into adjacent layers (Keating et al., 
2003).  Infiltration and runoff procedures are responsive to soil cover.  All water balance 
 
 
45 
calculations are constrained to the user specified root zone depth, which is generally error 
prone due to measurement uncertainties.  An alternative to the simplified tipping bucket 
approach is found in the APSIM - SWIM (Connolly et al., 2001).  This module uses the 
SWIM model to numerically solve Richard’s equation and the convection dispersion 
equation to determine infiltration, runoff, soil moisture content and solute transport 
(Keating et al., 2003). 
Daily root growth is proportional to the above ground biomass growth, depending 
on the growth stage.  Root depth exploration can be limited by compaction and pH 
(Robertson et al., 2002).  A specific root length parameter converts root biomass to 
length, which is then used to determine water uptake in the SWIM module.  When water 
supply is less than potential transpiration, determined using the Penman – Monteith or 
Priestly – Taylor approaches, transpiration is reduced to equal the potential root water 
uptake, simulating stomatal closing (Robertson et al., 2002).  Under this condition, a 
water stress factor acts to reduce the rate of leaf area expansion.  Likewise, under water 
limiting conditions, photosynthesis is limited by using WUE and the actual transpiration 
(Robertson et al., 2002). 
 
2.8.4 Modeling crop response to salinity 
Many models which determine water and solute flow in the soil from numerical 
solutions of Richard’s equation and the convection–dispersion equation, account for 
salinity effects in the way in which root water uptake (RWU) is handled.  In these 
models, two general approaches are used to simulate RWU. The model type first 
formulated by Gardener (1964) is referred to as the microscopic approach, and considers 
the physics of water flow through soil micropores in response to soil conductivity, water 
potential gradient between the root and soil, and the rooting density distribution with 
depth.  This type of model was modified by Nimah and Hanks (1973) to include both soil 
matric and osmotic potentials in the potential gradient term.  The macroscopic approach 
is based on empirical reduction functions, α(h,ho), which reduce water uptake from a 
maximum (usually potential plant transpiration) in response to lowered water potential 
(matric, h, and osmotic, ho).  This type of model, modified to include salinity effects, is 
found in Feddes et al. (1976), van Genuchten (1987) and Homaee et al. (2002b) among 
 
 
46 
others.  Excellent reviews of different model forms are found in the literature (Homaee et 
al., 2002a; Green et al., 2006; Skaggs et al., 2006a). 
The macroscopic model was judged to be much more representative of actual root 
water uptake in response to salinity stress in a comparison of the microscopic model of 
Nimah and Hanks (1973) and the macroscopic model of van Genuchten (1987) (Cardon 
and Letey, 1992a),.  The microscopic model of root water uptake was unresponsive to 
salinity when the soil was moist, and dropped sharply to zero as the soil dried.  Cardon 
and Letey (1992a). 
Within the macroscopic models of root water uptake, different methods exist for 
accounting for the relative effects of water and salinity effects including additive (van 
Genuchten, 1987; Cardon and Letey, 1992b), multiplicative (van Genuchten, 1987; 
Skaggs et al., 2006b)  as well as hybrids or combinations of these types (Homaee et al., 
2002b).  In a comparison of six types of macroscopic uptake terms, Homeaa et al. 
(2002a) determined the additive term (van Genuchten, 1987) performed the worst in all 
cases.  Shalhevet and Hsiao (1986) found the effect of water stress to be twice that of 
salinity stress with equivalent water potential  This raises doubts about the theoretical 
validity of an additive approach.  Homaee et al. (2002a) found their own multiplicative 
combination reduction model (Homaee, 2002b) performed best under almost all 
circumstances. 
The two terms in the Homaee et al. (2002b) reduction function coincide with the 
water stress reduction factor of Feddes et al. (1976) and the salinity reduction factor of 
Maas and Hoffman (1977).  Their model is essentially the same as that proposed by van 
Dam et al. (1997) except Homaee et al. (2002b) increased the water potential 
corresponding to the permanent wilting point, to increase with increasing salinity by 
adding the osmotic potential to the potential corresponding to the wilting point.  One 
caution is that the Maas and Hoffman (1977) reduction function was formulated to relate 
soil salinity to relative yield, not ET or root water uptake.  However, the general form of 
the model should be valid if reductions in yield roughly parallel reductions in water 
uptake with the appropriate yield response factor (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and 
appropriate choices of the constants a and h*o (Green et al., 2006).  Homaee et al. (2002b) 
appear to apply directly the coefficients from Maas and Hoffman (1977) and cite the 
 
 
47 
availability of these coefficients for a wide variety of crops as the main reason they chose 
this particular salinity reduction function  over others (van Genuchten, 1987; Dirksen and 
Augustijn, 1988) with harder to obtain parameters.  
From the literature cited above, it is clear that approaches exist to model root 
water uptake in response to salinity.  However, most of the hydrological models include 
only very elementary crop model routines that ignore climate, management and genetic 
factors that govern crop growth.  While the current version of CROPGRO does not 
consider the effects of soil salinity or groundwater contribution on crop growth, other 
crop models have attempted to incorporate a salinity response.  CROPSYST uses the 
macroscopic empirical reduction function of van Genuchten (1987) and adds osmotic 
potential to the matric potential in calculating the soil-root water potential gradient 
(Ferrer-Alegre and St?ckle, 1999).  Ferrer-Alegre and St?ckle (1999) found the approach 
was very successful in predicting transpiration and biomass production for experiments 
growing barley and sweet corn, and provided reasonable predictions of yield (Ferrer-
Alegre and Stockle, 1999).  It is not clear how osmotic potential is estimated from the 
field collected data and their model requires significant parameterization. 
 
A second approach to modeling crop response to salinity is found in Castrignano 
et al. (1998) using CERES (DSSAT family of models) with maize.  Castrignano et al. 
(1998) reduced photosynthesis as a function of the pre-dawn leaf water potential.  Pre-
dawn leaf water potential was calibrated to the total water content of two soils at three 
salinity levels to the leaf water potential.  The agreement of their model to observed data 
was very good for LAI, yield and biomass and good for transpiration on a silt loam, and 
less satisfactory for a clay soil. 
 
Rodriguez and Nuttall (2003) investigated the factors that would best describe a 
salinity response in APSIM-Wheat.  Their approach was to determine if the effect of 
salinity, sodicity and/or boron toxicity in soils on (i) the water availability at -1500 kPa 
(permanent wilting point) or (ii) the ability of roots to explore a particular soil layer could 
lead to prediction improvements of APSIM-Wheat in the marginal soils.  The greatest 
improvements were realized when salinity (note that the EC of the soil studied was not 
specified) was used to reduce the water availability, followed by using salinity to reduce 
root exploration.  However, the authors concluded that their results indicate that more 
 
 
48 
work needs be conducted to improve the model’s performance under conditions of 
substantial soil salinity.  Thirteen percent of their residuals in yield were attributed to soil 
salinity, indicating important, if not major, effects of salinity unrelated to water 
availability. Previous work with APSIM-Wheat had simply proposed that soil constraints 
(salinity, sodicity, or boron toxicity) act to raise the water content near the permanent 
wilting point (Sadras et al., 2003). 
 
2.9 CONCLUSIONS 
 
In light of climate change and increasing water scarcity and insecurity, the need 
for improved water management in agriculture and irrigation becomes ever more 
important.  This is particularly so in Uzbekistan where the economy is heavily dependent 
on irrigated agriculture and environmental degradation due to irrigation has numerous 
consequences.  The science of evapotranspiration under standard conditions is well 
understood and established, and has been so since the pioneering work on Penman (1948) 
and later refinements of Monteith (1965).  However, when water, salinity or nutrients 
limit evapotranspiration, understanding of the crop physiology and engineering 
application limits one’s ability to adapt to a changing climate and water regimes.  With 
improved knowledge of the fundamental processes, applications can be developed to 
manipulate the natural crop response to water stress, as is the case in partial root zone 
drying and deficit irrigation.  Finally, there is a huge potential for synthesis between the 
fields of salt stress physiology, water stress physiology, evapotranspiration science, 
irrigation engineering and agronomy in what could lead to significant steps forward in 
adapting to climate change with great environmental and, ultimately, societal impacts. 
Crop modeling offers the potential to integrate the many fields and highlight 
knowledge gaps for researchers.  More importantly, well tested models give farmers, 
technicians and those who make policy using agriculture tools to develop their 
management decisions.  This is believed to be especially valuable in developing countries 
where the ability to take risks may be very low for all levels of stakeholders. The choice 
of crop model is determined by the intended use of the outputs, whether it be a farm-level 
decision weighing the economics of trying a different management technique or 
 
 
49 
conservation practice, policy analysis of allocation of irrigation water or irrigation water 
pricing, as an educational aid in teaching crop physiology to undergraduate and graduate 
students, or in conducting physiology experiments to highlight areas where current 
understanding of crop processes are not sufficiently well understood.  From the literature 
review CROPGRO was judged the most able to respond reasonably well to all of these 
factors based on its detailed account of crop physiology, ability to differentiate growth 
responses in similar crops, transferability to other vegetable crops, flexibility in defining 
agronomic management scenarios and history of testing and validation in many locations 
and climates.  However, it is not without its shortcomings, many of which are addressed 
in other models, specifically not considering soil salinity.  It is hypothesized that 
CROPGRO can be improved by incorporating a salinity response function based on the 
most successful approaches reviewed.

CHAPTER 3: WATER USE EFFICIENCY OF COMMON BEAN 
AND GREEN GRAM GROWN USING ALTERNATE FURROW AND 
DEFICIT IRRIGATION 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
The pressure on water resources in the Fergana Valley of Central Asia is expected 
to increase, as population and industrial activity grow.  Increasing water use efficiency 
(WUE) associated with crop production is a way for arid and semi-arid areas to increase 
their agricultural production where there is little or no prospect for expansion of water 
resources.  The WUE of two water saving irrigation technologies were evaluated for two 
legumes, grown as a second crop, in the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan.  Conventional and 
alternate furrow irrigation and three irrigation schedules were used to irrigate food 
legumes in a field experiment conducted over two growing seasons (2003 and 2004) after 
winter wheat harvest.  The treatments consisted of factorial combinations of three factors, 
organized following a split-plot randomized complete block design with four blocks: 
three irrigation schedules (recommended, moderate and severe depletions) as the main 
plot factor and combinations of the two irrigation strategies (conventional and alternate 
furrow irrigation) and two crops (vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek and phaseolus vulgaris) as 
the two sub-plot treatment.  The WUE was quantified for commercial yield, above 
ground biomass and root biomass per unit of irrigation water applied and per unit of 
water evapotranspired.  The results of this study indicate that the WUE for both 
commercial yield and biomass were approximately twice as high for green gram as for 
common bean.  Conversely, the water use efficiency for root biomass in common bean 
(0.15 kg m-3) was slightly higher than green gram (0.13 kg m-3).  WUE increased in green 
gram when deficit irrigation or alternate furrow irrigation were practiced, whereas it 
remained constant in common bean for all treatment combinations.  These results suggest 
that common bean is not as well suited to water scarce conditions as green gram.  
Alternate furrow irrigation and deficit irrigation are appropriate methods to increase 
WUE, allowing application of less irrigation water, particularly for green gram 
production.

3.1 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Extensive environmental degradation of the Aral Sea basin has been the price of 
Uzbekistan’s irrigated agriculture (cotton and wheat) dependent economy.  The pressure 
on water resources is expected to increase as the requirements for increased food 
production and industrial needs increase in parallel with the country’s rapidly growing 
population (Micklin, 2000).  The improvement of on-farm irrigation systems and the 
introduction of low cost water saving irrigation technologies have been identified as key 
components of reducing agricultural water demand (Horst et al., 2005).  Increasing water 
use efficiency (WUE), defined in this paper as the amount of plant material produced per 
unit of water transpired, is a way for arid and semi-arid areas to increase their agricultural 
production where there is little or no prospect for expansion of water resources.  Wallace 
(2000) indicates that there are two approaches to increasing crop WUE.  The first is by 
adopting technologies that increase the proportion of water that is transpired by the crop, 
as opposed to that lost to drainage, runoff or seepage.  The second approach is to increase 
the crop’s capacity to produce biomass (assimilate CO2) and yield per unit of water 
transpired.  Passioura (2004) adds that, from a farmer’s perspective, increasing the 
harvest index (ratio of seed yield to total biomass) is a practical third approach to 
increasing WUE. 
Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and alternate furrow irrigation (AFI) are two 
water saving technologies that are relatively inexpensive and easy to implement.  Both 
strategies involve manipulating the soil water to induce the crop’s inherent response to 
drought conditions (Davies et al., 2002).  In water scarce environments, the goal is 
generally to increase the WUE.  The same strategies may be used in the production of 
other crops, but with different objectives.  For instance, in vineyards the objective is 
typically to retard vegetative growth and influence fruit quality (Loveys et al., 2004).  In 
RDI, the irrigation water requirement is not completely fulfilled, allowing the soil water 
 
 
53 
to be depleted beyond a threshold, such that the crop experiences water stress.  The crop 
response, which may or may not include a reduction in the rate of water use and/or yield 
reductions, depends on the degree of soil drying, the crop characteristics and the timing 
of the water deficit.  It is generally thought that withholding water during the vegetative 
period, as opposed to the flowering or fruit forming stages, has less impact on final yields 
(Loveys et al., 2004).  The water savings associated with RDI are attributed to reductions 
in stomatal conductance, which occurs as a result of the plant roots encountering drying 
soil, and precedes any change in leaf water potential.  Stomatal regulation is thought to be 
mediated by chemical signals originating in the roots and traveling to the guard cells via 
the xylem.  Further, these signals are now thought to involve both abscisic acid (ABA) 
and the alkalization of the xylem flow, associated with soil drying (Loveys et al., 2004; 
Wilkinson, 2004).  While the stomata control both the rates of transpiration and CO2 
entry into the cell, some evidence suggests that initially the reduction in stomatal 
conductance is greater than the concurrent reduction in carbon assimilation.  This results 
in increased instantaneous WUE values (Chaves and Oliveira, 2004).  While some studies 
show that RDI improves WUE on a seasonal basis (Oweis et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 
2000), other investigators have not found consistent evidence that WUE increases with 
deficit irrigation (Garside et al., 1992; Kang et al., 2000c; Lawn, 1982). 
Partial root drying (PRD) is a variation of RDI that generally improves the WUE 
of crops, for example pot grown tomatoes (Davies et al., 2000) and pot grown common 
bean (Wakrim et al., 2005).  In many cases, the strategy circumvents the yield losses 
frequently associated with RDI, as in grape (Loveys et al., 2000), soybean (Graterol et al., 
1993) and pot and field grown maize (Kang et al., 1998; Kang et al., 2000a; Kang et al., 
2000b).  PRD involves exposing part of the root system to drying soil while maintaining 
other sections in well watered soil, and is most effective when the two sections of roots 
are alternately exposed to wet and dry soil (Kang et al., 1998).  The method is thought to 
work via a reduction in stomatal conductance mediated by a chemical signal generated in 
the roots when they are exposed to drying soil, as in RDI.  This physiological response of 
the plant, due to exposure of some of its roots to drying soil while the plant is kept well 
hydrated by other roots in moist soil, is hypothesized to cause the benefits associated with 
PRD.

For furrow irrigation systems, PRD is practiced as alternate furrow irrigation.  
Wakrim et al. (2005) found the WUE of common bean increased, though with significant 
yield decreases, for both RDI and PRD in a pot experiment, and that there were no 
differences in yield or WUE between the two strategies. 
The objectives of this study were (i) to quantify the effects of alternate furrow 
irrigation and RDI on the WUE (for each of commercial seed yield, above ground 
biomass, and root biomass per unit of water transpired, WUEseed, WUEbiomass and 
WUEroot, respectively) of common bean and green gram and (ii) to determine the optimal 
irrigation schedule and irrigation water requirement for each crop, in order to maximize 
their WUE. 
 
3.2 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
3.2.1 Site description, experimental design and crop varieties 
Two seasons of field data were collected during 2003 and 2004 on two different 
adjacent fields on the private farm, ”Azizbek-1”, in the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan 
(40°23′N, 71°45é).  Despite the close proximity of the fields, the soil characteristics and 
groundwater depths differed between site-years.  For the 2003 site, the soil in the top 60 
cm was classified as a silt loam. with a coarser texture at depths greater than 1 m that 
prevented a groundwater contribution from the water table, which was at an average 
depth of 2.2 m.  The available water content in 2003 was 96 mm in the top 60 cm of the 
soil.  There was more variability in the field used in 2004, with the soil type ranging from 
a sandy loam to a silt loam over the field and an available water content of 75 mm in the 
top 60 cm.  The groundwater table was also considerably higher and varied along the 
length of the field, with an average depth of 1.45 m.  At the start of August, the 
groundwater table rose to within 40 cm of the soil surface in some locations and 
contributed significantly to the soil water in the root zone for a period of less than one 
week, due to excessively heavy irrigations in an adjacent field. 
The experimental layout was a randomized complete block (four blocks), split-
plot design.  The treatments were comprised of factorial combinations of three factors: 
irrigation schedule (main-plot factor - recommended rate, moderate and severe soil water 
 
 
55 
depletion), irrigation strategy (conventional furrow or alternate-furrow irrigation) and 
crop (common bean or green gram).  The combinations of furrow irrigation strategy and 
crop made up the split-plot treatments.  Each plot measured 15 by 15 m and contained 23 
furrows 12 m in length.  All sampling was conducted within a central 5 by 5 m quadrat.  
The average field slopes were 0.0024 and 0.0023 m/m in 2003 and 2004, respectively.  
Due to variations in slope across and along the field, and the relatively short length of the 
experiments furrows, there was variability in slopes between and within individual plots. 
Local varieties of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and green gram (Vigna 
radiata) were planted half way between the top of the bed and the furrow bottom.  Beds 
were 60 cm apart.  In 2003, planting was carried out on July 13 and local practices were 
followed for planting density, resulting in a fairly sparse plant stand, 70,000 and 105,000 
plants/ha for green gram and common bean, respectively.  In 2004, the seeding date was 
July 11 and the plant density for both crops was increased to 333,000 plants/ha, to be 
comparable with densities found in similar studies at locations elsewhere in the world 
(Haqqani and Pandey, 1994).  In both years the cropping history consisted of cotton the 
previous year followed by winter wheat, which was harvested in early July.  Pest and 
weed control were conducted as required. 
 
3.2.2 Irrigation scheduling and management 
In both years, a pre-irrigation of approximately 800 m3 ha-1 was applied to every 
furrow in each plot, at 2 days before seeding.  The purpose of this irrigation was to bring 
the soil in the 60 cm root zone to field capacity and to create a good seedbed.  At the time 
of emergence, a second irrigation of 600 m3 ha-1 was applied, also to every furrow, to 
encourage a full and even plant stand. 
Subsequent irrigation scheduling was determined using daily water balances, 
which were determined for each of the twelve treatments.  Each water balance calculated 
excess or deficit water in the crop root zone relative to field capacity.  Inputs to the 
system considered were irrigation water requirement, precipitation and groundwater 
contribution.  The only water output considered was crop evapotranspiration (ET), as 
deep percolation and runoff were assumed to be negligible. 
 
 
56 
Crop ET was determined from the water balance as the sum of precipitation, 
ground water contribution, irrigation water and the soil water use over the growing 
season.  Additionally, crop ET was predicted, to use in irrigation scheduling, with the 
FAO Penman-Monteith equation using weather data collected at the experimental site and 
crop coefficients for standard and stress conditions, as appropriate (Allen et al., 1998).  
The method assumes that water stress occurs when the root zone water deficit is greater 
than recommended depletion of the available soil water, which is 45% of the readily 
available soil water for both green gram and common bean.  In response to water stress, 
the crop reduces ET from a maximum value, ETmax, under non-stressed conditions to a 
value ETactual, given by: 
max
ET
k
ET
s
actual=
 
 
 
 
 
 
[1] 
where ks is the water stress coefficient.  The water stress coefficient varies linearly 
between 1 (no water stress) and 0 (permanent wilting point, or 100% depletion). 
The groundwater table depth was measured every three days at three and five 
locations across the field, respectively in 2003 and 2004.  As stated above, there was no 
ground water contribution to the root zone in 2003.  In 2004, the groundwater 
contribution was estimated using an empirical model (Ayars et al., 2006) that takes into 
account the distance between the root zone and groundwater table, soil type, ET, and the 
soil moisture content.  The model was validated using field data  using the water balances 
for the recommended irrigation schedules for common bean and green gram, where the 
non-stressed ET was estimated using the FAO Penman-Monteith equation. 
Irrigations were applied when the root zone water deficit equaled the maximum 
allowable depletion of the available soil water (Table 3.1).  For the FAO recommended 
irrigation schedule, or no stress condition, the plots were irrigated when 45% of the 
available water was depleted.  The depletion factors, pnominal, for the moderate stress 
treatments were 60% for common bean and 65% for green gram.  For the treatments 
receiving the largest water stress, the depletion factors were 70% for common bean and 
80% for green gram.  The depletion factors, p, are not constant and vary as a function of 
their nominal value, pnominal, and ETactual, as given in the following relationship (Allen et 
al., 1998):

Soil moisture measurements, made two days before and two days after each 
irrigation and every five days between irrigations, were used to check the water balance, 
particularly the effect of the water stress coefficient and the predicted groundwater 
contributions.  Soil moisture was measured gravimetrically at 0, 10 and 20 cm depth and 
with a neutron probe at 40 and 60 cm, in the centre of 2 furrows in the conventional 
furrow treatment plots and in the centre of 4 furrows in the alternate furrow treatments.  
The gravimetric soil moisture measurements were converted to volumetric values by 
multiplying by the soil bulk density.

Plots were irrigated using either conventional or alternate furrow irrigation.  In 
conventional furrow irrigation water is introduced into every furrow in the plot.  In 
 
 
58 
alternate furrow irrigation water is introduced into only every second furrow.  In this 
study, the furrow receiving water is alternated between successive irrigations. 
The literature contains very little on irrigation scheduling for alternate furrow 
irrigation systems.  As a result, there was a change in the scheduling methodology for 
alternate furrow irrigation to ensure the water savings possible with this strategy.  In 
2003, separate irrigation schedules were used for the conventional and alternate furrow 
treatments within the same crop and depletion factor.  In the alternate furrow treatments, 
the average of a wet and dry furrow’s soil moisture was used in the water balance.  As a 
result, the alternate furrow treatments had lower soil water contents and two of the 
alternate furrow irrigation treatments received one irrigation event more than their 
corresponding conventional furrow irrigation treatments.  In 2004, the methodology was 
modified slightly to ensure equal numbers of irrigations for the alternate and conventional 
furrow corresponding treatments and significant water savings for the alternate furrow 
irrigation treatments.  Irrigations for the alternate furrow treatments were applied on the 
same day as the corresponding conventional furrow treatment, with the result that only 
75% of the water was applied. 
In both years, initial inflow rates were selected using the SIRMOD software 
package (ISED, 1989).  Within each experimental plot, the lower ends of the furrows 
were blocked, so there was no outflow.  Inflows to each plot were measured with small 
portable flumes and from there distributed by field staff as evenly as possible to each of 
the furrows.  Due to the high variability of slopes between plots, inflow rates were often 
adjusted to ensure the advance time (the time for the water front to reach to the end of a 
furrow) was approximately equal to one half of the total irrigation time.  Small inflow 
rates were used for high efficiency and uniformity, as required with short furrows.  As a 
result, it was not possible to measure the inflow into individual furrows.  However, 
micromanagement of flow rates to individual furrows prevented ponding.  The choice to 
use shorter furrows than commonly found in other irrigation studies was justified as the 
simultaneous collection of data on irrigation scheduling and crop response to drought 
required very high distribution uniformity to ensure all along a furrow received the same 
depth of irrigation water.

3.2.3 Biomass  and yield measurements 
Seed and biomass yields were used to compute the respective WUE values.  In 
2003, common bean was harvested four times between October 3 and November 1 and 
green gram was harvested eight times starting September 21 with the final harvest on 
November 2.  In 2004, harvest dates were September 20 and October 3 for common bean 
and green gram was harvested four times between September 21 and October 9.  All 
plants within a central 5 m quadrat were harvested.  One day before harvest, a 50 cm 
section of row was sampled to determine the above ground biomass and, in 2004 only, 
the root biomass. 
 
3.2.4 Statistical analysis 
 
Statistical significance for detection of differences between various means 
was determined using the general linear model (GLM) procedure of the Statistical 
Analysis System (SAS, Cary, N.C., U.S.A.).  Differences between specific least-square 
means were determined using t-test at P ≤ 0.05.  Data were analyzed separately in 2003 
and 2004 as the fields used in the respective years differed in soil type, water holding 
capacity, groundwater depth, plant density and the irrigation scheduling for alternate 
furrow irrigation was slightly modified in 2004. 
 
3.3 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
3.3.1 Seed, above ground and root biomass yields 
The seed, above ground and root biomass yields are given in Table 3.2. 
(Bourgault, 2008).  For common bean, RDI at the moderate depletion level produced the 
same seed yields as the recommended irrigation schedule, whereas seed yields decreased 
with the large depletion factor.  In green gram, RDI produced the highest yields, though 
the level at which the highest yields occurred changed between years.  In 2003, RDI at 
the moderate depletion level produced the same seed yields as the recommended 
irrigation schedule, whereas seed yields decreased with the large depletion factor.  In 
2004, green gram yields increased with the use of the large depletion factor.  For root 
 
 
60 
biomass production, there was a strong interaction between crop and RDI.  At the level of 
the large depletion factor, common bean increased root biomass yields while in green 
gram root biomass decreased at this level. 
The irrigation strategy did not have an effect on common bean or green gram seed yields 
in 2003.  In 2004, there was a strong interaction between the irrigation strategy and crop.  
Common bean yielded slightly less when alternate furrow irrigation was implemented 
compared to conventional furrow irrigation.  Green gram yielded higher with alternate 
furrow irrigation.  The irrigation strategy had no effect on the above ground biomass in 
2003 and caused a decrease of 9% in 2004 when alternate furrow irrigation was used.  It 
had no impact on root biomass yields.

3.3.2. Water use efficiency (WUE) 
Crop effects 
In both 2003 (Fig. 3.1) and 2004 (Fig. 3.2), the mean WUEseed was approximately 
twice as large for green gram (0.45 and 0.54 kg m-3) compared to common bean (0.26 and 
0.34 kg m-3).  The differences between years were probably due to the different planting 
densities and, possibly, ground water contributions.  WUEbiomass was also over twice as  
large for green gram as for common bean in both 2003 (Fig. 3.3) and 2004 (Fig. 3.4).  
Averaged across all treatments, the ratio of WUEseed to WUEbiomass, or the harvest index 
(HI), was smaller in green gram than for common bean in both 2003 (0.21 to 0.27) and 
2004 (0.21 to 0.28), though this effect is considered minor relative to the larger 
magnitudes of the WUEs of green gram.  WUEroots (Fig. 3.5) was less, across all 
treatment combinations, for green gram, with an average value of 0.16 kg m-3 compared 
to 0.19 kg m-3 for common bean.  Green gram invested proportionally more of its 
photosynthetic resources into yield and biomass production per unit of water transpired, 
whereas common bean invested more heavily in root production. 
 
Irrigation schedule effect 
When RDI was practiced, the response of the two crops was very different.  For 
common bean, WUEseed remained constant across all treatment combinations at 0.26 kg 
m-3 (2003) and 0.34 kg m-3 (2004).  Likewise, WUEbiomass was constant across all stress 
levels.  While WUEseed and WUEbiomass did not change when subjected to soil drying, the  
HI decreased at the severe stress level.  WUEroots increased to 0.23 kg m-3 with the large 
depletion factor, from 0.16 kg m-3 for the well watered treatment.  This indicates that 
common bean sensed the water deficit in the soil and responded by investing more 
photosynthetic resources in root production per unit of water use in an attempt to extract 
more water.  However, this strategy was not able to translate into increased values of 
WUEseed or WUEbiomass.  Green gram responded to RDI by increasing its WUEseed by 48% 
(moderate depletion) in 2003 and 95% (large depletion) in 2004.  With the use of RDI, 
WUEbiomass also increased compared to the recommended depletion.  Like common bean, 
green gram responded to the severe water stress by increasing its WUEroots.  However, 
while common bean increased its root biomass under severe stress; green gram actually 
 
 
62 
reduced its root biomass (Table 3.2).  The increase in WUEroots for green gram is 
therefore explained by the greatly reduced water use at the high stress level (data 
presented in Chapter 4).  This suggests that the two crops use very different mechanisms 
to respond to soil drying; common bean produced more roots whereas green gram 
reduced its rate of water use. 
The difference in the two crops’ responses is further illustrated by looking at the 
HI.  In 2004, at the recommended and moderate depletion levels, the HI was lower in 
green gram (0.21) than common bean (0.37).  At the severe stress level, the ratio was 
reversed; HI was greater for green gram (0.34) than common bean (0.28), with the 
probability of significance taken as P < = 0.10.  Common bean’s decrease in HI with 
water stress was also evident in 2003 (18% decrease), though only statistically significant 
at the P <= 0.11 level and the HI in green gram was the same at all levels of RDI.  It 
seems clear that the two crops react oppositely under severe water stress; in common 
bean, the HI decreases, whereas it remains the same or increases for green gram.  It 
appears that under stress common bean partitions less of its resources to seed production 
and more to root production.  The strategy to extract more water by developing more root 
biomass comes at the expense of seed production. 
 
Irrigation strategy effects 
The effect of alternate furrow irrigation on WUEseed differed between the crops.  
Alternate furrow irrigation had no effect on the WUEseed in common bean across all 
levels of water stress, contrary to the findings of Wakrim et al. (2005).   In green gram, 
WUEseed increased by 10% in 2003 (P <= 0.10) and by 31% in 2004 compared to the 
conventional furrow irrigation treatments.  The larger difference in 2004 is expected due 
to the modifications in irrigation scheduling as detailed in the Materials and Methods 
section.  There was no evidence of interaction between using alternate furrow irrigation 
and the level of water stress imposed on the WUEseed.  WUEbiomass was unchanged in 
common bean by alternate furrow irrigation, and in green gram it was unchanged in 2003 
and increased by 16% in 2004.  WUEroots increased in both crops when the strategy was 
used in combination with RDI.

3.3.3 Optimal irrigation schedule and irrigation water requirements 
The volume of applied irrigation water given in Table 3.1 is the sum of the pre-
irrigation, a small irrigation at the time of emergence and all subsequent irrigations.  The 
climatic conditions were similar for both years, with little variation in reference crop 
evapotranspiration (ETo) between years (Fig. 3.6).  Rainfall amounted to only 17 and 5 
mm in 2003 and 2004, respectively. 
Alternate furrow irrigation produced water savings of 25% for both crops at all 
irrigation levels in 2004.  In the first attempt, in 2003, to find an optimal irrigation 
schedule using alternate furrow irrigation, average soil moisture values from both the wet 
and dry furrows were used for irrigation scheduling in the alternate furrow plots.  As a 
consequence of this, the soil moisture values were always drier in the alternate furrow 
treatments.  As a result, the alternate furrow plots were irrigated more frequently and, in 
2003, no consistent pattern of water saving was realized compared to the corresponding 
conventional furrow irrigated plots.  It was decided that in extending the FAO-56 
 
 
66 
methodology for irrigation scheduling to alternate furrow irrigation systems, only the soil 
moisture in the wetted furrows should be considered to ensure water savings.

Based on the results of the two seasons of field work, it is possible to make 
irrigation recommendations to maximize the WUEseed of green gram grown as a second 
crop in the Fergana Valley, and probably in a wider area of central Asia.  Implementing 
RDI and irrigating in alternate furrows produced the highest WUEseed, yield and the 
greatest seasonal water savings.  In 2003, there was no groundwater contribution and the 
moderate depletion factor produced the highest WUEseed with no yield losses.  This 
involved a pre-seeding irrigation, a second small irrigation a few days after seedling 
emergence and two vegetative irrigations applied when the soil water depletion was 65%.  
In 2004, with a groundwater contribution (Table 3.1), the large depletion factor gave the 
highest WUEseed and yields. This strategy included a pre-seeding irrigation, a second 
small irrigation at seedling emergence and one full irrigation when the soil water 
depletion reached 80%, coinciding with the time of flowering.  Based on the findings for 
green gram’s WUE and yield (Bourgault, 2008), it can be concluded that the FAO 
 
 
67 
irrigation recommendations for this crop (Allen et al., 1998) led to over irrigation and 
reduced yields. 
Based on the results of this experiment, no irrigation recommendations can be 
suggested to maximize WUE for common bean.  As WUE was constant for all levels of 
water stress and alternate furrow irrigation, any reduction in water use resulted in a 
corresponding reduction in yield.  In deciding on an irrigation schedule, farmers would 
need to weigh the relative cost of yield losses with water savings in choosing an 
appropriate soil water depletion factor. 
The differences in WUE between the two crops when subjected to soil water 
deficits clearly indicate that the crops employ very different mechanisms in response to 
drought conditions and require different approaches for irrigation.  When subjected to 
RDI at the large depletion level, the average irrigation requirement for green gram was 
reduced by 43% (2003) and 50% (2004) whereas the irrigation requirement for common 
bean was reduced by only 15% (2003) and 22% (2004).  Green gram’s physiological 
response makes it an excellent crop to irrigate with alternate furrow and deficit irrigation 
techniques, both to save water and increase WUE.  When subjected to soil drying, it has a 
mechanism that enables it to reduce its water consumption while maintaining yields.  
Common bean’s physiological response to drought does not lend itself to either of the 
two water saving technologies.  Unlike green gram, which appears to closely regulate its 
water use, common bean did not reduce its irrigation requirement, but invested in root 
development.  Common bean’s strategy was not successful at improving its WUEseed and 
any reduction in applied water resulted in yield reductions. 
 
3.4 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
Both alternate furrow irrigation and deficit irrigation practices can reduce 
irrigation water requirements and increase water use efficiency, important considerations 
for arid and semi-arid climates.  Consistent water savings, of close to 25%, are realised 
with alternate furrow irrigation over conventional furrow irrigation and, when used in 
combination with deficit irrigation scheduling, water savings can be as large as 50% with 
no yield reductions, as compared to the recommended irrigation volumes.  However, this 
 
 
68 
study indicated that the success of these technologies depends largely on the ability of the 
crop to withstand and/or adapt to water stress.  Green gram’s WUE was twice that of 
common bean.  When less water was applied to green gram, WUE doubled as compared 
to the recommended irrigation amounts.  On the other hand, the commercial seed and 
above ground biomass WUEs of common bean were constant for all combinations of 
deficit irrigation and alternate furrow irrigation, suggesting it is not as well adapted to 
water-scarce conditions.

CONNECTING TEXT TO CHAPTER 4 
 
 
The previous chapter identified alternate furrow and deficit irrigation as two 
irrigation strategies capable of increasing water use efficiency for legume crops grown as 
second crops in the Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan.  However, of the two crops evaluated, 
green gram showed much greater potential to improve water use efficiency than common 
bean.  This chapter investigates seasonal water use, patterns of water extraction and 
transpiration rates to describe and compare the differential responses of the two crops to 
water deficit imposed by these technologies.  The results of this chapter will inform the 
modeling work in a following chapter and serve as guides in selecting crops with similar 
responses to water deficit.

CHAPTER 4: PLANT - SOIL WATER DYNAMICS OF ALTERNATE 
FURROW AND REGULATED DEFICIT IRRIGATION FOR TWO 
LEGUME CROPS 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
Water scarcity and severe environmental degradation are causing water managers 
in Central Asia to reevaluate irrigation water use.  In this area, the goal of any 
intervention must include water conservation without reducing crop productivity.  The 
objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of two irrigation technologies, 
regulated deficit irrigation and alternate furrow irrigation, on components of the plant-soil 
water system for common bean and green gram.  The use of both deficit irrigation and 
alternate furrow irrigation resulted in water savings and reduced crop evaporative 
consumption.  The reduction was greater in green gram than common bean when both 
technologies were used.  The pattern of water extraction from the soil profile, when under 
stress, was different between the crops.  Severely stressed common bean extracted more 
water at 60 cm than non-stressed plants, whereas severely stressed green gram used less 
water at all depths.  Transpiration rates were generally lower for green gram than for 
common bean and decreased in both crops as soil water deficit increased.  However, 
when the soil water was returned to field capacity by irrigation, common bean’s water use 
was higher than the non-stressed condition while green gram’s transpiration rate only 
increased slightly from the before irrigation value.  Collectively, these results indicate 
distinct crop-dependent responses to soil drying.  Use of the FAO’s water stress 
coefficient in predicting evapotranspiration under water limiting conditions appears to 
over predict water use for green gram and could lead to over-irrigation; considerable 
water savings are available for this crop.

4.1 
INTRODUCTION 
 
As in most arid and semi-arid regions, drought and water scarcity influence many 
aspects of life in Uzbekistan.  Irrigation is required for almost all crop production, and 
agriculture forms the backbone of the country’s economy.  When Uzbekistan was a part 
of the Soviet Union, intensive land and infrastructure development during the 1960’s 
resulted in the rapid doubling of its irrigated area and Uzbekistan gained the status of the 
world’s 4th largest cotton producer, with 8 million acres of irrigated land.  This same time 
period saw water withdrawals from the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers increase from 
60.6 km3 to 105.0 km3 and the population of the five countries in the Aral Sea basin 
increase from 14.1 to 41.5 million (UN/SPECA, 2001).  The result of this development 
was greatly reduced flows in the basin’s rivers and the drying of the Aral Sea.  This is 
considered one of the most serious anthropogenic environmental disasters in history.  
Since the  early 1980’s, when water withdrawals for irrigation left virtually no water for 
the Aral Sea, progress has been made to address the region’s water scarcity (Micklin, 
2000).  However, the pressure on water resources is expected to increase as the 
population grows and water management is transferred to farmers in a state controlled 
system requiring them to produce cotton and wheat to gain access to water, other 
agricultural inputs and machinery.  The improvement of on-farm irrigation systems and 
the introduction of low cost, water saving irrigation technologies are identified as key and 
attainable components for reducing agriculture’s water demand (Horst et al., 2005).  
Furthermore, growing legumes as a second crop, after winter wheat, offers farmers a way 
to increase their income and improve both their food security and land productivity, while 
still fulfilling their commitment to produce cotton and wheat. 
Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and alternate furrow irrigation (AFI) are two 
water saving technologies that are relatively inexpensive and easy to implement.  Both 
strategies involve manipulating the soil water to induce the crop’s inherent response to 
drought conditions, usually in order to improve their water use efficiency (Hsiao et al., 
2007; Webber et al., 2006; Davies et al., 2002).  In RDI, the soil water is allowed to be 
depleted beyond a threshold value at which the crop experiences water stress.  Water 
savings generally result with the use of RDI and are attributed to reductions in stomatal 
 
 
72 
conductance which occur as a result of the plant roots encountering drying soil.  This is 
thought to be mediated by abscisic acid (ABA) and the alkalization of the xylem flow 
(Loveys et al., 2004; Wilkinson, 2004).  While the stomata control both the rates of 
transpiration and CO2 entry into the cell, some evidence suggests that, initially, the 
reduction in stomatal conductance is greater than the concurrent reduction in carbon 
assimilation.  Whether this always results in increased WUE remains unclear as evidence 
exists to show that it can cause both increased and decreased WUE (Garside et al., 1992; 
Kang et al., 2000b; Lawn, 1982; Webber et al., 2006).  Partial root drying (PRD), 
practiced as alternate furrow irrigation (AFI) in surface irrigation systems, is a variation 
of RDI that generally improves the WUE of crops (Davies et al., 2000; Wakrim et al., 
2005).  In many cases, the strategy circumvents the yield losses frequently associated 
with RDI, as in grape (Loveys et al., 2000), soybean (Graterol et al., 1993) and controlled 
environment and field grown maize (Kang et al., 1998; Kang et al., 2000a).  PRD 
involves exposing part of the root system to drying soil while maintaining other sections 
in well watered soil, and is most effective when the two sections of roots are alternately 
exposed to wet and dry soil (Kang, 1998).  The method is thought to operate in the same 
manner as RDI, with the benefit of keeping the plant well hydrated through roots still in 
moist soil. 
In a previous study, it was demonstrated that the water use efficiency of green 
gram could increase substantially if water savings irrigation technologies were used 
whereas the water use efficiency of common was constant under all irrigation strategies 
(Webber et al., 2006). In this study, different aspects of water use were studied to 
distinguish the responses of these two crops.  Particularly, root water extraction with 
depth in the soil profile and the plant transpiration rate were examined. 
The methodology suggested in the (Allen et al., 1998) to compute the rate of 
evapotranspiration (ETactual) when water conditions are limited, involves multiplying the 
maximum value of evapotranspiration, ETmax, achieved under optimal conditions by the 
water stress coefficient, ks 
max
ET
k
ET
s
actual=
. 
 
 
 
 
[1] 
The water stress coefficient varies between 1, when the crop does not experience 
water stress, and 0, when the soil is at the permanent wilting point.  In their model, a crop 
 
 
73 
is expected to experience water stress when the actual root zone depletion of total 
available soil water, Dr, exceeds a threshold value, the readily available water, RAW.  
When the depletion exceeds the readily available water (Dr > RAW), ks will decrease 
linearly from 1.  In the case that the actual depletion has not yet exceeded the readily 
available water (Dr > RAW), ks = 1 and the crop is not expected to experience water 
stress.  This condition holds for crops that have previously experienced water stress and 
are subsequently irrigated, irrespective of the length or severity of the preceding soil 
water deficit.  This method does not explicitly account for conditions of variable soil 
drying, as is the case of AFI. 
In an attempt to contribute to the understanding of irrigated food crop production 
systems when water is limited, this study looks the water use response and extraction of 
two legume crops as affected by the use of RDI and AFI.  The specific research 
objectives were: (1) to evaluate the effect of using regulated deficit and alternate furrow 
irrigation, alone or together, on patterns of water extraction from the soil profile, and (2) 
to assess the ability of the FAO Penman-Monteith equation to predict ET under water 
limiting conditions by comparing to the ET estimate obtained from the water balance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
4.2.1 Experimental design, site description and cropping systems 
A field experiment was conducted in the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan (40°23′N, 
71°45é) during the summers of 2003 and 2004.  A randomized complete block split-plot 
design, with four blocks was used where the treatments were comprised of factorial 
combinations of RDI level, as the main plot factor (recommended, moderate and large 
depletion factors), and furrow irrigation strategy (alternate furrow (AFI) and conventional 
furrow (CFI)) plus crop (common bean and green gram), comprised the sub-treatments.  
Each plot measured 15 m by 15 m and contained on average 23 furrows of 12 m length.  
The furrow spacing was 60 cm. 
Adjacent fields were used in the two years in order to have the same cropping 
rotation in both experimental years.  Cotton was grown in the year previous to the 
experiment, followed by a crop of winter wheat which was harvested early in the 
 
 
74 
following summer.  The legume crops were planted following winter wheat harvest.  The 
soil textures in the rooting zones were similar in both years (Table 4.1).  In 2003, the 
surface silt loam was 54 cm in depth and the available water content was 96 mm in the 60 
cm rooting zone.  In 2004, the thickness of the surface silt loam layer averaged 34 cm and 
the available water content in the rooting zone was 77 mm.  Average groundwater depth 
was 2.2 m in 2003 and 1.5 m in 2004.  In the field used in 2003, a coarse layer of soil at 
depths of greater than 1 m effectively prevented a groundwater contribution to the root 
zone.

Local varieties of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and green gram (Vigna 
radiata) were sown, following winter wheat, in mid-July.  Local varieties were used as 
they are adapted to the conditions prevalent in the region.  The same seed stock was used 
in both years.  Cotton was grown on both fields in the year preceding the experiment, so 
that subsequent production of a legume constitutes a double cropping system.  The fields 
were planted on July 13 in 2003 and July 11 in 2004.  In 2003, local practices were 
followed for seeding resulting in planting densities of 70,000 and 105,000 plants/ha for 
green gram and common bean, respectively.  In 2004, the plant density was increased to 
333,000 plants/ha for both crops, to be comparable with densities found in similar studies 
(Haqqani and Pandey, 1994).  While the changes in density between years is the weak 
point in the methodology, the water use between years should still be comparable, with 
 
 
75 
the exception of the green gram treatment with the highest depletion level.  The leaf area 
index between years was very similar (Bourgault, 2008) and the crop coefficients used in 
the FAO 56 methodology are largely a function of percentage ground cover (or leaf area). 
Further, yields between years were very similar, again with the exception of the driest 
green gram treatment (see Webber et al., 2006 from Bourgault, 2008)  In the field, this 
was observed nearly complete ground cover in 2003.  When the density was lower, 
individual plants were able to grow larger.  Only in the driest green gram treatment was 
the ground cover judged as less than full.  Pests and weeds were controlled as required. 
 
4.2.2 Water balance 
Daily water balances were used for subsequent irrigation scheduling.  The 
approach used in this study for the water balances deviates from the water balances used 
in typical irrigation studies, much as the method of imposing water stress deviates 
substantially from that typical of controlled experiments in plant stress physiology.  
Rather, this study is attempting to chart a middle ground between these two approaches 
and integrate knowledge from both fields. 
The root zone was treated as a constant at 60 cm throughout the growing season.  
Although, this is a simplification, it was assumed for two reasons.  Firstly, the plant roots 
are continually growing into wet soil.  Secondly, from a practical perspective, the 
irrigation application efficiencies associated with the small irrigation depths that would 
result from using a small root zone are prohibitively low. 
A separate water balance was used for each of the twelve treatments to account 
for the amount of available water (relative to field capacity) in the crop root zone.  Inputs 
considered were irrigation requirement (Irri), effective precipitation (Pi) and groundwater 
contribution (GWCi), where i is the day index.  Crop evapotranspiration (ETc,i) was the 
only output considered, as the furrows were blocked at their lower ends, so there was no 
runoff water.  Drainage and deep percolation were not considered, as only the irrigation 
requirement (and not the actual depth of water applied) was used in the balance.  This 
practice of neglecting the deep percolation is not acceptable for water balance studies, but 
was implemented for this study, which had the objective of investigating the crop 
response to deficit irrigation and alternate furrow irrigation.  The goal was to ensure all 
 
 
76 
plants along the central 5 m of each 12 m long furrow received the full irrigation 
requirement.  A study in an adjacent field on the same farm used a more typical water 
balance approach and furrows measuring 400 m in length to quantity irrigation 
efficiencies and savings in irrigation volumes of alternate furrow irrigation, overcoming 
the limitations of using microplots (Horst et al., 2005; Horst et al., 2007).   
All variables for the water balance are expressed in mm as follows:

where SWuse,i is the soil water use relative to field capacity on day i and SWuse,i-1 is the 
soil water use relative to field capacity on the previous day.  To gauge the accuracy of the 
ETc,i  = ksETmax estimates, and to adjust the water balances to reflect actual water 
consumption of the stressed crops, root zone soil moisture was monitored.  Measured 
volumetric soil moisture (SM%vol,i) values were converted to SWuse,i according to:

where FC%vol is the soil moisture content at field capacity and drootzone is the depth of the 
root zone (mm). The measured estimate of SWuse,i was then substituted into the balance 
[2] replacing the value calculated in [3] each time soil moisture was measured. 
Soil moisture values were determined, on average, every five days.  Additionally, 
they were measured two days before and two days after irrigations events.  Soil moisture 
was measured gravimetrically at 0, 10 and 20 cm depth and with a neutron probe at 40 
and 60 cm.  Ideally, soil moisture would have been measured to greater depths but, due to 
equipment limitations and the large number of samples, measurements were not taken 
below 60 cm.  However, to test this assumption, soil moisture was monitored to 100 cm 
depth in the four plots of the green gram moderate depletion treatment.  No variations in 
soil moisture, greater than the regular measurement error, were noted in these plots.  In 
2003, measurements were taken in triplicate mid-length along one furrow in the 
conventional furrow treatment plots and in 2 furrows in the alternate furrow treatments.  
The 0 cm mark was taken half way between the furrow bottom and bed top, at the level 
plants were seeded.  In the alternate furrow treatments, one sample was taken from a 
furrow that had been irrigated and the other from a furrow that had not been irrigated in 
the previous round of water application.  In 2004, the number of spatial samples was 
 
 
77 
doubled to address the variability in soil properties (two samples from conventional 
furrow treatments and four samples from the alternate furrow treatments), but the number 
of replicates was reduced to two due to oven space limitations. 
Precipitation was measured with a Vantage Pro Meteorological Station (Davis 
Instruments Corp., Hayward, USA) located in a neighboring field.  Effective precipitation 
was taken as 75% of the actual rainfall (Allen et al., 1998). 
To estimate the daily groundwater contribution (GWCi) the following empirical

The regression coefficients are reported as a = 3.9, b = 3.8 and c = 0.5 (Wu et al., 
1999).  Zmax (m) is a function of soil type.  Both the groundwater table depth (dGWT) and 
drootzone in [5] are expressed in m.  The groundwater table depth was measured every three 
days at three (2003) and five (2004) locations across the field.  To calibrate Zmax for this 
set of data, the water balances for the recommended irrigation schedules of common bean 
and green gram were used.  The non-stressed ETc,i, estimated using the FAO Penman–
Monteith equation, was assumed accurate for fitting the GWCi to the measured soil 
moisture values. 
ETc was calculated as the product of the FAO Penman-Monteith reference 
equation for reference crop ET (ETo) and crop and stress coefficients, as appropriate 
(Allen et al., 1998).  The climate data used to determine ETo included minimum and 
maximum daily temperatures (Tmin and Tmax), minimum and maximum daily relative 
humidity (RHmin and RHmax), wind speed measured 2 m above ground (u2) and sunshine 
 
 
78 
hours (N).  With the exception of N, all weather observations were measured with a 
Vantage Pro Meteorological Station (Davis Instruments Corp., Hayward, USA) located in 
a neighboring field.  Sunshine hours were obtained from a neighbouring weather station 
located approximately 20 km from the field.  The climatic conditions were very similar 
between years as demonstrated in a plot of daily ET in Webber et al. (2006). 
 
4.2.3 Irrigation scheduling 
To prepare the seedbed and bring the soil water to field capacity, a pre-irrigation 
of approximately 56 mm (net) was applied to every furrow in every plot, 2 days before 
seeding.  Note that the exact amount applied was a function of the soil moisture at the 
time of harvest of the preceding wheat crop.  Following seeding, at the time of 
emergence, a second irrigation of 42 mm (net) was applied, also to every furrow, to 
encourage a full and even plant stand. 
All subsequent irrigation scheduling was based on the average soil water content 
in each treatment.  For a given treatment j, an irrigation was applied when SWuse,i,j 
equaled that treatment’s maximum depletion of the available soil water (MDj) was 
reached or exceeded:

In 2003 this methodology was used for all twelve treatments, resulting in twelve 
irrigation schedules.  As a result, some of the alternate furrow irrigation treatments 
 
 
79 
received an extra irrigation because these treatments reached the specified depletion more 
quickly, having received less irrigation water.  In 2004, the methodology was changed to 
ensure significant savings in applied water for the alternate furrow irrigation treatments, 
to allow the crop response to reduced water application to be evaluated.  The number of 
irrigation schedules was reduced to six; alternate furrow treatments were irrigated on the 
same day as the corresponding conventional furrow treatment, applying only 75% of the 
water. The 25% reduction is based on an estimate of the percentage of volume under the 
dry furrow that does not contain a significant number of plant roots. 
 
4.2.4 Irrigation Applications 
Irrigation volumes to be applied were determined by dividing the irrigation 
requirement from the water balances by an irrigation efficiency of 70%.  This value was 
later shown to be a conservative estimate of the irrigation efficiency (data not shown) but 
was used to ensure a high distribution uniformity so that all of the plants received the full 
irrigation requirement, to accurately access the stress associated with each depletion 
level.  Initial inflow rates were selected using the software package SIRMOD (ISED, 
1989).  The model uses a modified Kostiakov infiltration equation.  The parameters of 
this model governing the initial water infiltration were determined with a ‘‘two-point’’ 
method (Walker and Skogerboe, 1987) using inputs of the advance times at the middle (6 
m) of representative furrows and the end (12 m) of the same furrows.  The parameter 
governing the steady infiltration rate, fo, was determined from the inflow–outflow balance 
after the outflow rate was stable, following the methodology outlined in Horst et al. 
(2007). 
The down-slope ends of each furrow, within each experimental plot, were 
blocked, so there was no outflow.  Inflows to each plot were measured with small 
portable flumes.  The water entered a distribution ditch at the top of each plot.  From the 
distribution ditch, water was distributed by field staff as evenly as possible to each of the 
23 to 24 (conventional furrow) or 11 to 12 (alternate furrow) furrows.  Due to the 
variability of slopes between plots (land leveling is generally needed throughout the 
Fergana Valley), inflow rates were often adjusted to ensure that advance time across the 
plot was approximately equal to one half of the total irrigation time.

4.2.5 Transpiration measurements 
Instantaneous transpiration rates were measured from ten plants per plots every 
two days before and two days after irrigation events using a LICOR-1600M diffusion 
porometer (Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska USA) between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm. 
 
4.2.6. Statistical analysis 
The statistical significance of applied treatments was tested using the general 
linear model (GLM) of the Statistical Analysis System (SAS, Cary, N.C., U.S.A..).  
Differences between specific pairs of means were tested with a t-test.  Unless otherwise 
specified, differences were only considered significant when they were detected at a 
probability of P ≤ 0.05.  Data were analyzed separately in 2003 and 2004 as the fields 
used in the respective years differed in groundwater contribution and the plant densities 
were also different between years. 
 
4.3. 
RESULTS 
 
4.3.1. Water balance components 
The water balance components are summarized in Table 4.3.  These values were 
used to calculate the crop consumptive use of water (ETbalance).  The use of the deficit 
irrigation schedules resulted in fewer irrigation events for both crops, as compared to the 
recommended schedule. 
In 2004, the water applied to the alternate furrow treatments was 75% of the water 
applied to the corresponding conventional furrow treatments leading to consistent savings 
in applied water.  The same magnitude of savings in applied water was not realized in 
2003 for reasons indicated above.  However, the seasonal changes in soil water were 
lower in 2003 (Table 4.3) which enabled reductions in crop water use (results presented 
in the following section) and soil water storage for AFI.

4.3.2 Crop consumptive water use: water balance 
RDI reduced the crop consumptive water use (ETbalance).  Averaged across both 
crops and irrigation strategies, use of the large depletion factor resulted in reductions in 
water use of 19% (2003) and 28% (2004) compared to the recommended irrigation 
schedule.  However, RDI produced greater water savings for green gram than for 
common bean, as indicated by the crop by depletion factor interaction present in both 
years (Table 4.4).  In green gram, the moderate depletion factor saved 20% (2003) and 
16% (2004) of the water used and the large depletion factor 26% (2003) and 40% (2004), 
compared to the recommended irrigation schedule.  Note that the water savings for the 
moderate and large depletion factor are not different in 2003, a point that will be 
discussed later in the paper.  For common bean, the magnitude of water savings was 
much smaller.  Use of the moderate depletion factor reduced water use by 6% in 2004 
and not at all in 2003 while the large depletion factor used 14% (2003) and 10% (2004) 
less water than the recommended depletion factor.

Use of AFI as the irrigation strategy resulted in water savings of 9% (2003) and

4.3.3. Crop consumptive water use: FAO Penman – Monteith estimate 
Using the FAO Penman – Monteith estimate of evapotranspiration (ETFAO), RDI 
schedules were predicted to produce water savings.  Implementation of the large 
depletion factor resulted in a 21% reduction, over the recommended irrigation schedule, 
in water use in both years. 
The FAO Penman – Monteith equation predicted the larger water savings for 
green gram than common bean with RDI (Table 4.4).  However, this crop by depletion 
was only significant in 2004 (p values of 0.3457 and <0.0001 in 2003 and 2004, 
respectively), when reductions in water consumption with the large depletion factor were 
30% in green gram compared to only 12% in common bean, relative to the recommended 
depletion factor. 
For the irrigation strategy, the FAO Penman – Monteith estimate of ET correctly 
predicted water savings for AFI in 2004 when reductions in water use were estimated as 
7% less than those irrigated with CFI (Table 4.5).  The reduced crop consumption in 
2003, albeit smaller than 2004, was not captured by the FAO Penman – Monteith 
equation.

4.3.4. Distribution of water use in the soil profile 
By design, the soil moisture previous to each irrigation event was lower with RDI.  
The distribution of soil water use as affected by RDI is evaluated by investigating 
seasonal soil water changes.  Different irrigation schedules resulted in different dates and 
numbers of irrigation events, making a comparison between individual events 
problematic.  The profile of the soil water extraction was highly biased to the soil surface 
(0 cm) for both crops, though to a greater extent for common bean, due to soil 
evaporation (Table 4.6).  Water extraction decreased with increasing depth in the profile. 
Averaged across both crops and irrigation strategies, RDI produced water savings 
in the 0 – 40 cm depth of the soil profile, with the exception of the 20 cm depth in 2004 
(Table 4.6).  At 60 cm, no water savings were associated with RDI.  Deeper in the soil 
profile, the response of the two crops varied with increasing stress under RDI.  While a 
strong crop by depletion interaction only occurred in 2004, the same trend is evident in 
the 2003 data.  Water use by common bean at 0 through 40 cm was greatest at the 
recommended and moderate stress irrigation levels.  At these depths, water use with the 
large depletion was reduced, though this was often not sufficient to allow statistical 
significance.  At 60 cm, the situation was reversed; common bean treatments with RDI 
consumed more water than the recommended level.  In 2004, the large depletion used 
more water and in 2003 the moderate depletion level consumed the most water.  Green 
gram did not respond similarly.  The severe stress irrigation level used less water at 
depths 0 to 60 cm (excepting 20 cm depth where all treatments consumed the same 
quantity of water).  At the 60 cm depth, where common bean consumed most water with 
RDI, green gram had reduced (2004) or equivalent (2003) use. 
In AFI treatments, the average soil moistures were lower than the corresponding 
CFI treatments, as only one of every two furrows received water in an alternate furrow 
irrigation event.  In 2003, the AFI plots reached the set depletion more quickly and were 
irrigated more often than the corresponding CFI treatment (Table 4.3).  The method was 
modified slightly in 2004; AFI plots were irrigated on the same schedule as their 
corresponding CFI treatment, to ensure water savings, and equal number and timing of 
irrigations.  For the seasonal water use, AFI produced significant water savings at all 
depths in the soil profile averaged over both crops (Table 4.5).  While the crop

by strategy interaction was not significant in all cases, the relative reduction in water 
use with AFI was at least 1.5 times greater for green gram than common bean for all 
depths in the profile (Table 4.7). 
 
4.3.5. Transpiration rate 
Prior to the irrigation at the time of flowering, transpiration rates were higher 
in common bean than green gram when averaged across all treatment levels (Fig 4.1).  
The crops responded differently to increasing levels of RDI, as indicated by crop by 
depletion factor interactions.  With increasing levels of water stress under RDI, 
common bean reduced its transpiration rate in 2004.  However, in 2003 the highest 
rate of transpiration occurred with the moderate depletion factor.  Green gram 
exhibited the opposite behaviour; transpiration remained unchanged (2003) or slightly 
increased (2004) with the use of RDI.  For the irrigation strategies, AFI did not reduce 
transpiration rates.  In 2003 transpiration was the same for AFI and CFI at 8.6 μg m-2 
s-1 (p value of 0.53).  In 2004, AFI plots had an average transpiration rate of 8.8 μg m-
2 s-1, slightly higher than the conventional furrow plots at 7.5 μg m-2 s-1 (p = 0.0040). 
After the flowering irrigation, the transpiration rate was still higher in 
common bean than green gram, when averaged across all treatment levels (Fig 4.2).  
The effect of RDI on the transpiration rate of common bean seems to be to allow 
common bean to increase its transpiration rate considerably and transpire at a rate 
equal to (2003) or greater than (2004) the unstressed treatments.  For green gram, the 
picture was not as consistent across years.  In 2003, irrigation caused the plots with 
the large depletion factor to increase their rate of transpiration, while it stayed the 
same in 2004.  In both years, the transpiration rate remained lower than or equal to 
that in the plots with the recommended depletion factor.   The transpiration rate was 
slightly greater for the CFI treatment than the AFI treatment.  In 2003, transpiration in 
AFI plots was 9.6 μg m-2 s-1 and 11.3 μg m-2 s-1 in CFI (p = 0.0002) with green gram 
having greater reductions in transpiration than common bean (data not shown).  In 
2004 the rate was 11.3 μg m-2 s-1 for both AFI and CFI and the crop by depletion 
interaction present in 2003 was highly non - significant.

DISCUSSION 
 
Both RDI and AFI reduced the crop consumptive water use for both crops.  
Green gram has shown greater potential to reduce its water use and maintain yield 
 
 
89 
levels (Bourgault, 2008) and increase water use efficiency (Webber et al., 2006), 
making it an excellent candidate for irrigation with either of these technologies.

The responses of the two crops to both technologies show some important 
differences which may help explain their different degrees of water savings.  Water 
stress due to implementation of RDI caused common bean to reduce its water use by 
 
 
90 
10% and 14%.  This reduction in water use was observed as small reductions in soil 
water extraction at shallow depths in the profile and little regulation of transpiration.  
However, at 60 cm depth it caused the beans to extract more water than the unstressed 
control.  To do so, it must use more of its carbon stores to produce roots, possibly at 
the expense of seed production.  This hypothesis is supported by increased root 
biomass of common bean and decreased seed yields with RDI (Webber et al., 2006; 
Bourgault, 2008). 
The response of green gram to RDI allowed much larger water savings when 
the technique was implemented.  To explain this phenomenon with this field data it 
was necessary to disregard the large depletion factor in 2003.  Factors such as seed 
placement and the irrigation timing for the large depletion factor resulted in a severely 
stressed crop, with a leaf area index (LAI) of less than one half that of the 
recommended and moderate depletion factor treatments (Bourgault, 2008).  The 
unclosed canopy probably created a much greater vapour pressure deficit (VPD) than 
present at the either the recommended or moderate depletion levels, which would 
have caused higher transpiration rates independent of any treatment effects.  Better 
early irrigation control and seed placement eliminated this severe reduction in LAI in 
2004.  Therefore, the proposed response for green gram to RDI is that it appears to 
reduce its water consumption by decreasing its rate of water extraction and 
transpiration, as reported by Lawn (1982).  Though the severely stressed treatment 
received only one irrigation in 2004, the yield reductions reported in Lawn (1982) 
were possibly avoided as the irrigation was applied at flowering.  Unlike common 
bean, which produced greater root biomass to extract more water deep in the profile, 
green gram root biomass decreased with RDI (Webber et al., 2006).  Unlike common 
bean, after irrigation events the transpiration rate increase for green gram was small 
and did not reach the levels in the unstressed plants. 
The effects of alternate furrow irrigation on water use also seem to depend on 
the crop, but to a lesser extent than RDI.  While the magnitudes of seasonal water 
savings were greater in green gram than common bean, the difference was not 
statistically significant.  However, examining the patterns of soil water extraction 
suggest that greater reductions in water use with this strategy exist for green gram.  In 
 
 
91 
neither year did common bean reduce water use at 60 cm depth in the profile when 
AFI was used.  However, the increases in root biomass which were observed for 
common bean with RDI were not found for AFI.  With this strategy, green gram had 
water savings at 60 cm depth in 2004, but not in 2003.  The transpiration data 
collected in this experiment do not provide any useful insights into understanding the 
water savings achieved by the strategy. 
The FAO Penman – Monteith equation was able to correctly predict water 
savings for both technologies.  In 2004, it also correctly captured the larger water 
savings of green gram when RDI was implemented. However, no consistent pattern 
of over or under prediction is present in the relative errors of ETFAO to ETbalance 
between years (Table 4.4) and when analyzed statistically, their model was non – 
significant.  However, examination of the relative errors raises some interesting points 
which are discussed below.  Firstly, in 2003, the magnitudes of the relative errors 
were all less than 10%, quite random and averaging to approximately zero for both 
crops.  However, there was a clear but small bias of over prediction in the case of AFI 
(data not presented).  The random error is consistent with the fact that half as many 
soil moisture samples were taken in 2003 as in 2004.  The calculation of both ETFAO 
and ETbalance are both very sensitive to the final soil moisture measurements, though 
they respond oppositely.  For example, a high soil moisture measurement indicates 
little soil water use and a low value of ETbalance.  The same high soil moisture 
measurement would lead to a high prediction of ETFAO as the plant would not be 
considered to be experiencing water stress.  Despite this sensitivity to soil moisture 
measurements, the FAO Penman – Monteith equation was able to correctly predict 
the 20% water savings for RDI, while not capturing the larger water savings for green 
gram than common bean.  When the relative errors are examined for 2004 a different, 
and likely more accurate, picture emerges due to doubling the soil moisture samples.  
ETFAO was larger than ETbalance by approximately the same amount for all treatments 
of common bean, suggesting a systematic bias unrelated to treatment effects (perhaps 
low canopy coverage or nitrogen stress as no fixing nodules were found in any of the 
common bean treatments, commonly reported for common bean (Smith and Hume, 
1985)).  This constant over prediction suggests that common bean is responding to 
 
 
92 
water stress much as the FAO Penman - Monteith model (Allen et al., 1998) predicts; 
a linear decrease in ET as the soil progresses from 45% depletion of the available soil 
water to the permanent wilting point.  A different pattern was evident in green gram; 
the relative error increased with the higher levels of RDI (Table 4.4) and AFI (data 
not shown).  The lack of a systematic error is consistent with the full canopy and 
apparent lack of nitrogen stress as the presence of some nodules was observed in 
green gram.  The increasing over prediction of water use for green gram with water 
stress suggests this crop is not responding to drying soil as predicted by the FAO 56 
methodology.  Evidence for this hypothesis is found in the transpiration rates 
measured after irrigation applications.  The model used in the FAO 56 methodology 
supposes that after irrigation, a previously stressed crop will transpire at the 
unstressed rate.  This was observed for common bean and not for green gram. 
 
4.5.1 CONCLUSIONS 
 
This research indicates that significant water savings are possible with the 
adoption of on-farm water saving technologies for irrigation of legumes as a second 
crop after wheat harvest in the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan.  The benefits to the 
local population due to growing legumes as a second crop while using water saving 
irrigation techniques include a protein rich food, increased land productivity with 
minimal irrigation or fertilizer input (due to legume nitrogen fixation) and improved 
land fertility and organic matter if the residue is incorporated into the soil. 
The results of this study indicate that both alternate furrow irrigation and 
deficit irrigation produce water savings by reducing the crop evapotranspiration.  
However, the degree to which water use was reduced and the mechanisms employed 
by common bean and green gram are different.  When RDI was practiced, green gram 
reduced evapotranspiration by 26 (2003) and 40% (2004), whereas the reduction in 
common bean was only 14 (2003) and 10% (2004).  With alternate furrow irrigation, 
the differences in water use between crops were much less pronounced; water savings 
for both crops averaged 9% in 2003 and 15% in 2004 and were constant across all 
irrigation schedules.  With severe stress, green gram reduced soil water extraction at 
 
 
93 
all depths in the profile, apparently through stomatal regulation.  Common bean 
responded by increasing root biomass to extract more water from deeper in the 
profile. 
The FAO Penman-Monteith equation was able to reasonably predict the water 
savings of both crops when either technology was implemented, though better for 
common bean than green gram.  The discrepancy seems to lie in the method’s 
assumption that following a period of stress, restoring the soil water through irrigation 
will cause the plant to transpire at its unstressed rate.  This phenomenon was observed 
for common bean under the severely stressed treatment, where common bean 
transpired at a rate higher than the non-stressed treatment after receiving irrigation.  
Green gram continued to transpire at a reduced rate even after irrigation water was 
applied.  When alternate furrow irrigation was practiced, the FAO method 
overestimated ET for both crops at all stress levels.  Before the FAO water stress 
coefficient can be improved, it will be necessary to better quantify both the responses 
to irrigation of stressed plants and the effect of alternately maintaining different 
sections of the roots in drying soil.

CONNECTING TEXT TO CHAPTER 5 
 
In addition to the challenge of water shortage in the Fergana Valley, increasing 
soil salinity limits agricultural production.  While rising water tables and soil salinity 
are problems in many irrigated areas, the gypsiferous soils of the Fergana Valley 
make transferring the accumulated knowledge on crop response to salinity difficult to 
the region.  For the most part, salinity effects are less severe in soils containing 
gypsum, though the legumes studied Chapters 3 and 4 are very sensitive to salinity.  
This chapter presents the results of a greenhouse study investigating the growth 
response of common bean and green gram to increasing salinity in a gypsiferous soil.  
Also, the interaction between the use of deficit irrigation and level of soil salinity in a 
gypsiferous soil is investigated.  
This chapter has been accepted for publication in 2008 as an original research 
manuscript in the ICID journal, Irrigation and Drainage, Manuscript ID IRD-08-0023.

CHAPTER 5: RESPONSE OF TWO LEGUME CROPS TO SOIL 
SALINITY IN GYPSIFEROUS SOILS 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
Competition for water resources, increasing land salinization and the need to 
feed a growing population are challenges facing irrigated agriculture in the Fergana 
Valley of Uzbekistan.  Growing short season legumes with water saving irrigation 
technologies is one strategy for increasing food production and land productivity 
using relatively little water.  However, little information is available to assess how 
these crops will respond when produced with deficit irrigation on the gypsiferous 
soils of the region.  This greenhouse study evaluated various growth components of 
common bean and green gram irrigated with deficit irrigation in soils with and 
without gypsum and at three levels of soil salinity.  Results showed that biomass and 
leaf area were decreased by approximately 20% for both crops, as ECe increased from 
2.8 dS m-1 to 7.5 dS m-1.  Yields were higher at all salinities for green gram than in 
common bean.  However, relative yield reductions with increasing salinity were 
greater for green gram (43%) compared to common bean (19 – 31%).  The presence 
of gypsum enabled both crops to maintain reasonable yield at ECe values which 
would be lethal in soils dominated by other salts.  The effect of increasing salinity 
was the same at all levels of deficit irrigation.

INTRODUCTION 
 
 Uzbekistan is one of the world’s largest cotton producers and exporters.  
Together with wheat, cotton cultivation occupies the largest share of the land area 
under arable crops and uses the largest proportion of the county’s surface water for 
irrigation.  As the pressure of the region’s scarce water resources increase, due to 
increases in population, growth in industry, land degradation and the growing 
 
 
96 
recognition of the negative impacts of irrigation on the environment in the wake of 
the Aral Sea crisis, much attention has been given to farm level practices to save 
water.  It was proposed that growing legumes as a second crop after winter wheat 
harvest as a means of increasing rural food security and improving land fertility 
(Webber et al., 2006).  When grown with water saving irrigation technologies, these 
crops yield well and use little water. 
 To assess whether these or other food crops are appropriate, the crops’ 
tolerance to soil salinity must be determined.  Secondary soil salinization in the 
Fergana Valley is widespread and increasing as the water table rises to within 1 to 5 
m of the soil surface, due to heavy leaching and old, poorly functioning drainage 
systems (EC-IFAS, 1999).  Cotton and wheat are salt tolerant (Maas, 1985) and by 
the time these crops show symptoms of salt stress, the land will already be rendered 
too saline for cultivation of many other crops.  However, compiled information of 
crop tolerance to salinity (Tanji and Kielen, 2002; Maas, 1985) is not easily 
transferable to the gypsiferous soils of the region (Szabolcs, 1989) because the salt 
tolerance is based on the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil paste extract 
(ECe).  The Ca2+ in soil solution in gypsum soils (CaSO4·H2O) increases its osmotic 
potential, reflected in higher ECe while protecting the plant from the negative effects 
of sodium salinity. 
 The current theory on how non-halophytes respond to salinity is considered in 
two distinct phases and has been articulated in a number of papers (Greenway and 
Munns, 1980; Munns and Termaat, 1986; Munns et al., 2000).  The first response is 
that of water stress, as leaf expansion rates are reduced long before ions accumulate to 
toxic levels in cells.  Work by Hsiao et al. (1998) showed that this initial response is 
governed by changes in turgor when the plant water status is low, as happens when 
plants transpire at their maximum potential in the middle of the day.  However, when 
water status did not limit growth, turgor maintenance did not prevent growth 
reduction due to salinity.  Work by Munns et al. (2000) monitoring leaf expansion 
during the day and night corroborated this.  Chemical signaling from the roots, in 
response to osmotic potentials, is thought to mediate the growth reduction of leaves 
when leaf water status is not limiting growth.  Much recent work points to the key 
 
 
97 
role of ABA produced in the roots in a series of complex interactions that constitute 
plant responses to low soil water potentials (Wilkinson and Davies, 2002).  The 
second stage of the crop response to salinity is leaf death due to the accumulation of 
Na+ and Cl- to toxic levels in cytoplasm.  Salts travel to the leaves in the xylem 
transpiration stream, with fully expanded leaves being most affected, as they have 
accumulated larger amounts of salts.  If the rate of leaf death outpaces that of leaf 
growth and expansion, leaf area decreases and plant death ensues (Munns and 
Termaat, 1986). 
 What would the outcome be in soils dominated by calcium salts?  The initial 
response is suspected to be lowered soil water potential would be similar as 
demonstrated by similar reduced growth rates with NaCl and other various osmotica 
(Yeo et al., 1991).  However, calcium can moderate the effects of sodium salinity, 
reducing growth reductions (Maas and Grieve, 1987; Eaton, 1942).  Calcium is 
required by the plant for root membrane integrity and proper function of ion transport 
systems (Lauchli and Epstein, 1970).  Salinity inhibits Ca2+ uptake, such that many 
studies investigating NaCl salinity observe calcium deficiency symptoms when the 
Na+/Ca2+ ratio is high (Greenway and Munns, 1980; Maas and Grieve, 1987) or with 
increasing NaCl levels (Lynch and Lauchli, 1985).  As common bean is considered 
more drought sensitive than green gram (Webber et al., 2006) the growth of common 
bean is expected to be more affected than that of green gram, at least initially when 
osmotic effects dominate. 
 The objectives of this research were (i) to compare the relative growth 
response at the  vegetative stage to increasing ECe in soils with and without gypsum; 
(ii) to evaluate the growth, water use and yield formation with soil salinity on a 
gypsiferous soil; and (iii) to investigate interactions between regulated deficit 
irrigation and soil salinity.  These objectives were tested on Vigna radiata (green 
gram, a drought adapted local crop (Webber et al., 2006)) and Phaseolus vulgaris 
(common bean, a crop introduced from the Americas and less drought adapted – 
Allen and Allen, 1981).

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
The influence of salinity on crop development and water use by two legume 
crops grown in simulated gypsiferous soils was evaluated in two greenhouse 
experiments conducted at the Macdonald Campus, McGill University in Montreal, 
Quebec during the spring and summer of 2007.  Uzbek varieties of common bean 
(Phaseolus vulgaris) and green gram (Vigna radiata) were used.  The soil type was a 
Soulonge fine sandy loam (67% sand; 20% silt; and 13% clay).  Chemical and 
physical properties of the soil are shown in Table 5.1.  The greenhouse temperature 
was 32°C during the day and 20°C at night with the photoperiod set at 14 hours per 
day.

In the first experiment, the effects of growing plants in gypsiferous soils on 
vegetative growth were assessed for different levels of total soil salinity.  The 
experimental layout was a randomized complete block (four blocks), split-plot design. 
The treatments were comprised of factorial combinations of three factors: crop (main-
plot factor—common bean or green gram), with and without gypsum, and three 
sodium salinity levels (no NaCl, low NaCl and high NaCl).  The combination of 
calcium salts and sodium salinity comprised the split-plot combinations.  Plants were 
grown in 3 L containers and irrigated daily to maintain the soil water content near 
field capacity.  Pest control was conducted as required.  Plants were harvested 
approximately four weeks after planting.  Dry leaf and stem biomass and leaf area 
were measured on all plants.  Leaf water potential was measured on two samples per 
plant with the WP4-T water potential meter (Decagon Devices, Washington, U.S.A.). 
Gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) was added to soil containers at a rate of 233 mEq per kg 
soil (or 20 g per kg soil).  Three NaCl levels were used: no NaCl, low NaCl (8.6 mEq 
 
 
99 
of NaCl added per kg of soil) and high NaCl (17.1 mEq of NaCl added per kg of soil).  
In soils without gypsum, the resulting ECe values were 0.3 dS m-1 for the no NaCl 
level, 2.8 dS m-1 for the low NaCl level and 5.0 dS m-1 for the high NaCl level.  In 
soils with gypsum, the resulting ECe values were 2.8 dS m-1 for the no NaCl level, 5.4 
dS m-1 for the low NaCl level and 7.5 dS m-1 for the high NaCl level.  
In the second experiment, the effects of sodium salinity in soils dominated by 
gypsum salts were evaluated for a number of plant growth parameters.  The 
experimental layout was a randomized complete block (four blocks), split-plot design 
(Fig. 5.1). The treatments were comprised of factorial combinations of three factors: 
crop (main-plot factor—common bean or green gram), salinity level (no NaCl, low 
NaCl and high NaCl) and three levels of deficit irrigation (recommended depletion, 
moderate depletion, large depletion).  The combination of soil salinity and irrigation 
schedule comprised the split-plot combinations.  Within a block and crop, containers 
were aligned to create a closed canopy.  Plants were grown in 160 L containers (50 
cm deep by 43 cm wide by 74 cm long).  Each container was drained along its length 
by a piece of 5 mm diameter perforated drainage and was sloped towards the drain 
opening.  Any drainage water was collected and reintroduced to the plant container to 
maintain a constant salt load. 
Gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) was added to all soil containers at a rate of 233 mEq per 
kg soil (or 20 g per kg soil).  The three NaCl levels were no NaCl, low NaCl (8.6 
mEq of NaCl added per kg of soil) and high NaCl (17.1 mEq of NaCl added per kg of 
soil).  This quantity of gypsum resulted in constant levels of dissolved gypsum at the 
range of soil water values between the permanent wilting point and field capacity, as 
would be encountered in gypsiferous soils.  The combinations of NaCl and gypsum 
gave ECe values of 2.8 dS m-1 for the no NaCl level, 5.4 dS m-1 for the low NaCl level 
and 7.5 dS m-1 for the high NaCl level.  Salts were mixed into the soil with a small 
portable cement mixer.  The capacity of the mixer was approximately half of the soil 
volume for one container, so the salts and soil were mixed in two equal batches. 
Prior to planting, seeds were soaked in an innoculant at 108 cells per mL for 24 
hours.  Seeds were sown in two rows per soil container and at an initial plant density 
 
 
100 
of 16 plants box-1. Experiments were started on March 21, 2007 and June 27, 2007.  
Plants were staked as required.  Pest control was carried out as needed.

experiment 2. 
 
Irrigation water was applied to the soil surface with a watering can.  The soil 
was irrigated to field capacity before planting and a second very small irrigation 
(about 3 mm) was applied to the soil surface a few days after planting.  All 
 
 
101 
subsequent irrigation amounts and dates were determined using daily water balances 
in a methodology similar to that described by Webber et al. (2006).  The three 
irrigation levels consisted of different depletions of the available soil water (ASW): 
recommended depletion (45% for both crops), moderate depletion (60% for common 
bean and 65% for green gram) and substantial depletion (70% for common bean and 
80% for green gram).  The soil water depletion was determined by gravimetric soil 
moisture measurements in each container.  Measurements were taken in each box at 
depths of 5, 20 and 40 cm, at least every day before irrigation.  Irrigations were 
sufficient to bring the soil water back to field capacity (0% depletion). 
Plant biomass and leaf area index were measured on two randomly selected 
plants per plot four times at approximately the vegetative, flowering, pod-filling and 
harvest stages.  Final yield was measured by harvesting all dry pods from all plants in 
the plot 70 days after planting (dap) and 76 dap for common bean and 76 dap and 91 
dap for green gram for experiments one and two, respectively.  Leaf water potential 
was measured with a WP4-T water potential meter (Decagon Devices, Washington, 
U.S.A.) for the central leaflet of two randomly selected trifoliates per plot.  In the first 
experiment, all treatments were assessed on the same day to eliminate any effects of 
ambient radiation, at both the vegetative and flowering stages.  In the second 
experiment, leaf water potential was measured pre-dawn one to two days after the 
irrigation at the flowering stage and again one day before the next irrigation.  The 
measurement was made pre-dawn to eliminate any effects of ambient radiation.  
Stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate were measured with a LICOR LI-6400 
porometer on the central leaflet of two randomly selected fully developed trifoliates 
per plot.  This measurement was made one day before and one to two days after the 
irrigation event nearest the flowering stage. 
Statistical significance for detection of differences between treatments was 
determined using the general linear model (GLM) procedure of the Statistical 
Analysis System (SAS, Cary, NC, U.S.A.).  Differences between specific least-square 
means were determined using a t-test at P ≤ 0.05, unless otherwise stated.

RESULTS 
 
 Addition of NaCl to the soil reduced above ground biomass for both crops, 
though a greater reduction was measured for green gram.  Gypsum reduced biomass 
in common bean and had no effect on green gram’s biomass.  Neither crop had a salt 
(NaCl) by gypsum interaction.  Common bean biomass decreased as a function of 
increasing ECe irrespective of salinity, due to a combination of NaCl and gypsum or 
NaCl alone (Fig. 5.2).  However, green gram biomass was not reduced to the same 
level in soil containing gypsum as it was in soil without gypsum, as ECe increased.  
At an ECe of 2.8 dSm-1, biomass in the soil with only NaCl was 28% (p = 0.12) lower 
than in the soil containing gypsum, and at an ECe of 4.9 to 5.4 dS m-1 biomass was 
56% lower in the soil with only NaCl than in the soil containing both NaCl and 
gypsum. 
 Leaf area decreased for both crops with higher levels of NaCl (Fig 5.3).  
Gypsum reduced leaf area in common bean, but not in green gram.  Leaf area for 
common bean decreased with increasing ECe with and without gypsum.  However, 
for green gram leaf areas were 29 to 32% higher at a particular ECe when the soil 
contained gypsum though without strong statistical significance. 
 Specific leaf areas are not presented here.  For common bean, no consistent 
pattern was observed as the SLA response varied between the two trials.  In green 
gram SLA was constant for all combinations of salinity. 
 Leaf number per plant decreased for both crops with increasing levels of NaCl 
(Fig. 5.4.).  The reduction was larger for common bean and occurred at all levels of 
NaCl.  Reduction in leaf number occurred for green gram only at the highest salinity.  
Leaf number was reduced as a function of ECe in common bean, whether the soil 
contained  gypsum salts or not.  For green gram, soil salinities dominated by gypsum 
salts did not cause the same reduction in leaf number as soil salinity dominated by 
sodium chloride at high salinities.

Results from the second experiment showing biomass and leaf areas as 
affected by salt treatment at four stages in crop growth are given in Table 5.2.  At the 
vegetative stage salt reduced growth more for green gram than for common bean.  In 
green gram a reduction in total biomass of between 27 and 31% was noted at the 
 
 
104 
highest level of salinity compared to the control.  Likewise, leaf area was reduced by 
27 to 30%.  In common bean the reduction in biomass was 11 to 16% at the highest 
soil salinity, though only statistically significant in the second trial.  Likewise, at this 
stage, common bean’s leaf area was hardly affected by salt level.  Salinity reduced 
leaf area by 10 to 23%, (again only significant in the second trial) at the highest level 
of salinity.  In neither crop was the reduction in biomass or leaf area due to salt 
influenced by the level of deficit irrigation.

 At flowering, increased soil salinity resulted in lower biomass and leaf area 
for both crops.  The leaf area of both crops decreased by 21% at the highest level of 
salinity.  This decrease in leaf area was the same for all levels of deficit irrigation.  
For biomass, an interaction existed between crop, irrigation schedule and salinity (p = 
0.0472).  At the recommended irrigation schedule, salt did not reduce flowering 
biomass in green gram, whereas it reduced biomass by 15% (medium level) and 24% 
(high level) in common bean.  Conversely, with the large depletion factor in deficit 
irrigation, the level of soil salinity had no impact on common bean biomass. 
 At pod-filling, there was no clear effect of soil salinity on total above ground 
biomass for either crop.  In general, biomass decreased with increased soil salinity by 
as much as 20%, but this decrease was statistically significant only for common bean 
in the first trial and for green gram in the second trial.  Likewise, leaf area was 
unaffected by the salinity level during the pod-filling stage for either culture, though a 
decreasing trend roughly paralleling that of biomass was present.  At this growth 
stage soil salinity reduced the number of leaves per plant in common bean, but did not 
affect this variable for green gram. 
 As mentioned in the methodology, data collected at the fourth sampling period 
in trial two represents harvest maturity for common bean only.  For green gram, the 
harvest in trial one corresponds to harvest maturity, whereas in the second trial, green 
gram had not yet reached maturity.  This is due to the higher levels of ambient light in 
the summer months when this trial was conducted (Lawn, 1979).  For this reason, the 
results discussed here do not consider the yield components of green gram for the 
second trial.  Total above ground biomass was reduced by 30% for common bean and 
20 to 29% in green gram at the highest level of soil salinity.  Dry weights of 
reproductive organs were likewise reduced in both trials for common bean, and the 
first trial for green gram.  Neither leaf areas nor leaf numbers differed with salt level 
at the final sampling.  Common bean final yield was reduced by 20 to 30% at the 
highest salinity level (Table 5.3).  The yield components (Table 5.3) that explain this 
reduction are reduced seed weight and the number of pods per plant.  The highest 
level of soil salinity reduced seed weight by 9 to 11% and the number of pods per 
plant by 17 to 32%.  However the reduction in the latter was only significant in the 
 
 
108 
second trial.  In both trials, irrigation schedule by salt level interactions existed for 
seed weight, but was not consistent between trials.  The number of seeds per pod was 
constant across all salt levels.   Green gram yield was reduced by roughly twice the 
amount of common bean yield, at the highest soil salinity (first trial only).  Both seeds 
per pod and pods per plant decreased with increasing salinity, while the seed weight 
remained constant.  Despite the larger reduction in yield of green gram, it maintained 
much higher absolute yields than common bean at all salinity levels. 
 Increasing NaCl salinity reduced crop consumptive water use in both crops 
(Fig. 5.5).  The reductions were more pronounced in green gram, with reductions of 6 
to 13% at the medium salinity level and 13 to 20% at the highest salinity level.  For 
common bean, water use was not reduced at the medium salinity level, but was 
reduced by 9 to 17% at the highest level.  In both trials a three way crop by deficit 
irrigation by salinity level existed (p = 0.11) (Bourgault, 2008).  The data indicated at 
low evaporative demand, increasing salinity did not decrease water use in common 
bean when no soil water deficit existed.  However, when the evaporative demand was 
higher (due to longer days), increasing salinity caused a  decrease in water use for all 
deficit irrigation levels.  For green gram, water use decreased with increasing salinity 
at all irrigation levels in both trials.  The larger water use, and possibly water use 
reductions with increasing salinity the second time this experiment was conducted is 
due to higher ET rates due to greater sunlight intensity and duration in July compared 
to April.

5.4 DISCUSSION 
 
During early vegetative growth, the presence of gypsum in soil did not enable 
common bean to tolerate higher ECe values; both common bean biomass and leaf area 
were reduced as a function of ECe in both soils with and without gypsum.  This is 
consistent with the idea that initially plant response to salinity is a water deficit effect, as 
common bean is considered to be more drought sensitive than green gram.  While the 
statistical results indicate the same for green gram, a clear trend in the data shows green 
gram biomass, and to a lesser degree leaf area, did not decrease as much in soils 
containing gypsum as they did in soils with only sodium salts. 
As for tolerance to absolute salinity level, at the vegetative stage, common bean 
seems able to withstand an ECe of 2.8 dS m-1 before either leaf area or biomass is 
decreased.  This is roughly the value predicted in Maas and Grieve (1987), as the salinity 
threshold for common bean is 1 dS m-1 and the tolerance should be increased by 1 to 3 dS 
m-1 if the soil contains gypsum.  However, the tolerance value estimated by considering 
the seasonal water use in the second experiment was 4.8 dS m-1 and the relative rate of 
reduction in water use 4.6%/dS m-1(Fig. 5.6).  Note, the salinity threshold listed in their 
work is based on yield potential where as these values are related to water use.  For green 
gram at the vegetative stage, at an ECe of 2.8 dS m-1 a decreasing trend, though not 
statistically significant, was observed in biomass (p = 0.13) and leaf area (p = 0.11) when 
the plants were grown in without gypsum, relative to soil containing gypsum.  The cause 
of this is unclear.  It can be speculated that this variety of green gram, which is native to 
Central Asia, is adapted to growth on the gypsiferous soils of the region.  Typically, 
calcium deficiencies are not expected at the Na+/Ca2+ ratios (6 and 9) used in this 
experiment, though it may have been the case for this variety (Greenway and Munns, 
1980).  When the seasonal growth and water use values are considered, the salinity 
tolerance is estimated at 2.6 dS m-1 and the relative rate of reduction in water use at 
3.5%/dS m-1 (Fig. 5.6). 
For both crops, biomass and leaf area decreased with increasing salinity as crop 
development progressed.  Generally the decrease in biomass was matched by a relative 
decrease in leaf area.  While biomass and leaf area of both crops decreased with 
 
 
112 
increasing stress, the growth reductions were less than the 19% per dS m-1 predicted for 
common bean (no values are listed for green gram) (Maas, 1985).  This suggests that of 
slope of the relationship presented by Maas (1985) may also differ with gypsiferous soils.  
The cause may be that the high levels of soil calcium prevented changes to root 
membranes that favour the entrance and accumulation of sodium and chloride ions in 
cells, and the effects of salinity were only osmotic effects.  It is then hard to comprehend 
why green gram has been affected to a larger degree as it is more drought tolerant.  Green 
gram suffered larger relative reductions in final yield than common bean did.  This is 
significant, as in a previous study, green gram was better adapted to deficit irrigation 
techniques (Webber et al., 2006).  These results can not determine if this is an indication 
of this particular variety’s sensitivity to salinity or high calcium requirement.

Some reports suggest that salinity problems may be more severe in dry soils as salts 
concentrations would increase as water was removed from the soil.  The lack of an 
interaction between deficit irrigation and soil salinity indicates that reduced deficit 
irrigation could safely be implemented in soils suffering from salinity.  One explanation 
may be that the larger application volumes in deficit irrigation result in leaching of salts 
to the bottom of the root zone.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
High competition for water resources and increasing land salinization are two 
challenges facing irrigated agriculture in the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan.  The 
country’s population is also experiencing rapid growth and will require increased food 
supplies.  Strategies to increase food production and reduce agricultural water use must 
be developed within this context of increasing land degradation due to salinization.  The 
region’s soils contain large amounts of gypsum salts, and the vast literature on crop 
tolerance to salinity is not easily transferable to these soils.  For the two legume species 
tested in this study, common bean and green gram, acceptable yields were attained at the 
highest level of salinization (ECe of 7.4 dSm-1).  Biomass and leaf area accumulation 
were reduced by approximately 20% as the salinity was increased from 2.8 to 7.4 dSm-1, 
which is considerably less than expected from the literature.  These results indicate that 
for gypsiferous soils, not only is the yield reduction threshold higher, but the rate of yield 
decline with increasing salinity is less severe than for soils dominated by sodium and 
chloride salts.  Finally, no interactions were found to exist between the application of 
reduced deficit irrigation and the degree of land salinization.

CONNECTING TEXT TO CHAPTER 6 
 
 
 
Two previous chapters identified and assessed deficit irrigation and alternate 
furrow irrigation as appropriate water saving irrigation technologies for growing common 
bean and green gram following winter wheat harvest in the Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan.  
A third chapter investigated the response of these two crops to soil salinity in a soil 
dominated by gypsum salts, which are typical of the region. 
 
This chapter addresses the use of a crop model as a planning tool for use of deficit 
irrigation in the region.  The model should be sensitive to crop physiology to detect the 
different responses to water deficit in legumes and should be responsive to soil salinity.  
The CROPGRO model is selected as it is considered the most physiologically based 
agronomic model available.  However, the current version of the model does not account 
for soil salinity.  This chapter highlights modifications to CROPGRO to model growth in 
saline soils and evaluates the new model qualitatively and quantitatively using the 
experimental results presented in Chapters 3 through 5.

CHAPTER 6: ADAPTING CROPGRO FOR REGIONS WITH 
SALINE SOILS 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
Increasing food insecurity, competition for scarce water resources and growing 
land salinization in the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan are forcing agricultural water users 
in the region to reevaluate irrigation practices.  Crop models play an important role in 
helping farmers decide which systems (crops and irrigation technologies) are feasible. 
The CROPGRO model is physiologically robust, though the current version does not 
consider the effects of soil salinity on crop water use or growth.  While CROPGRO’s root 
water uptake routine considers the physics of micropore radial water flow to roots, this 
method has been evaluated as largely inferior to empirical reduction functions in 
simulating root water uptake under conditions of soil salinity in hydrological based 
models.  An iterative process was employed that enabled an approach very similar to the 
empirical reduction functions.  A qualitative analysis of the models indicated that the 
model performed as expected under a range of atmospheric, irrigation and crop tolerance 
scenarios.  The Willmott agreement index, root mean square error, mean absolute error 
and relative error were employed to evaluate the model.  The modified model 
performance was excellent for yield and ET when evaluated for a greenhouse study at 
three levels of each deficit irrigation and salinity in a gypsiferous soil.  The modified 
model was successfully tested with field data, on common bean (Phaseolus vulgraris) 
from an experiment in the Fergana Valley, though the sensitivity of the model to a soil 
fertility function and relative nodule number made it difficult to assess the model 
performance.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Increasing food insecurity and competition for scarce water resources in the 
Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan are forcing agricultural water users in the region to 
reevaluate irrigation practices.  Despite high irrigation requirements, cotton and winter 
wheat are  the main crops produced in the country.  Farmers are required to produce these 
crops in a state order system, as cotton exports generate close to one third of the country’s 
gross domestic product.  However, the extent and degree of soil salinization increase each 
year due to rising water tables associated with heavy leaching.  As such, efforts to 
improve food security in the near term should respect farmers’ constraints on food crop 
production:  (i) needing to produce cotton and/or winter wheat, (ii) increasing soil 
salinity and (iii) having little available water (priority of use going to cotton).  
Inexpensive and easy to implement improvements to the region’s predominant surface 
irrigation systems have been identified and result in water savings (Horst et al., 2005; 
Horst et al., 2007; Webber et al., 2006).  Crop models play an important role in allowing 
farmers to decide which systems (crops and technologies) are feasible. 
CROPGRO is a widely used crop model and considered the most physiologically 
based agronomic model currently available.  Originally developed from individual 
legume models (Boote et al., 1986; Hoogenboom et al., 1992), CROPGRO now models 
twelve crops.  It is one of two primary crop models (the other being CERES) in the 
Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) software package.  
DSSAT manages soil, weather, and management and crop databases to simulate various 
agricultural and climatic scenarios over multiple years.  DSSAT can simulate twenty 
seven different crops, is over fifteen years old and has been applied in over one hundred 
countries.  The crop models contained in DSSAT are in modular form and comprised of 
one code for simulating soil water, nitrogen and carbon dynamics.  Crop growth and 
development are simulated with one of its constituent models.  By maintaining separate 
crop modules within DSSAT, the individual crop models can capture more of the species 
specific physiological differences while considering the same soil, climate and 
management scenarios (Jones et al., 2001; Jones et al., 2003).  Currently, CROPGRO 
 
117
does not consider the effects of soil salinity on crop growth.  This is a serious limitation 
for its application to regions such as Uzbekistan. 
Plant response to salinity is proposed by some authors (Munns and Termaat, 
1986; Munns et al., 2000) to encompass two phenomena; water deficit affects the plant 
immediately, while specific ion toxicity effects are noticeable weeks to months later, after 
thresholds of specific ions in leaf tissue are surpassed (Munns et al., 2000).  Water deficit 
effects are caused by the osmotic potential, due to salts or other osmotica (Yeo et al., 
1991), as perceived by the roots, and result in reduced cell elongation rates, with greater 
reductions occurring in the shoot than root cells (Munns and Termaat, 1986).  Others 
have determined that Na+ does induce an immediate reduction in leaf elongation rate, in 
addition to water deficit effects, before any increase in leaf Na+ concentrations are 
detected (Montero et al., 1998).  These authors found, at equivalent osmotic potentials, 
greater reductions in growth rates and increased xylem ABA concentrations with NaCl 
than concentrated nutrient solutions.  However, some work shows that many symptoms 
of Na+ toxicity are actually due to Ca2+ deficiency as salinity inhibits Ca2+ uptake when 
the Na+/Ca2+ ratio is high (Greenway and Munns, 1980; Maas and Grieve, 1987).  This 
could be the case in the previous study.  Calcium can moderate the effects of sodium 
salinity, attenuating growth reductions (Maas and Grieve, 1987; Eaton, 1942) and is 
required for root membrane integrity and proper function of ion transport systems 
(Lauchli and Epstein, 1970). The presence of calcium in gypsiferous soils of the Fergana 
Valley, Uzbekistan is believed to moderate the toxic effects of sodium salts by protecting 
membrane functioning and preventing calcium deficiency.  Therefore, an approximate 
salinity response factor, in gypsiferous soils under conditions of low to moderate soil 
salinity, could act to increase water stress at a given soil moisture, particularly for short 
season crops.   
Various hydrological based models, which determine water and solute flow in the 
soil from numerical solutions of Richard’s equation and the convection–dispersion 
equation, account for salinity effects in the way in which root water uptake, RWU, is 
handled.   A number of good reviews of different model forms are found in the literature 
(Homaee et al., 2002a; Green et al., 2006; Skaggs et al., 2006b), to which the reader can 
refer for specific formulations of the various RWU functions discussed here.  In these 
 
118
models, two general approaches are used to simulate RWU. The microscopic approach 
was first formulated by Gardener (1964), and considers the physics of water flow through 
soil micropores in the context of soil conductivity, K(h), water potential gradient between 
the root and soil, ΔΨ, and the rooting density distribution, RDF(z), with depth, z.  This 
type of model was modified by Nimah and Hanks (1973) to include both soil matric and 
osmotic potential in the ΔΨ term.  The macroscopic approach is based on the empirical 
reduction function, α(h,ho), which reduces water uptake from a maximum (usually 
potential plant transpiration) in response to lowered water potential (matric, h, and 
osmotic, ho).  This type of model, modified to include salinity effects, is described by 
Feddes et al. (1976), van Genuchten (1987), Cardon and Letey (1992b) and Homaee et al. 
(2002a, 2002b) among others. 
In a comparison of the microscopic model of Nimah and Hanks (1973) and the 
macroscopic model of van Genuchten (1987), the macroscopic model was judged to be 
much more representative of actual root water uptake in response to salinity stress 
(Cardon and Letey, 1992a).  The microscopic model of root water uptake was 
unresponsive to salinity when the soil water content was high, and dropped quickly to 
zero as the soil dried.  Cardon and Letey (1992a) explain this as being due to the large 
dependence of the term on soil conductivity, K(h) which changes drastically with changes 
in soil water content, masking the salinity response. 
Within the macroscopic models of root water uptake, different methods exist for 
determining the relative effects of water and salinity, including additive (van Genuchten, 
1987; Cardon and Letey, 1992b) and multiplicative (van Genuchten, 1987; Homaee et al., 
1999; Skaggs et al., 2006a),  as well as hybrids or combinations of these types (Homaee 
et al., 2002b).  In a comparison of six types of macroscopic uptake terms, Homaee et al. 
(2002a) determined the additive term (van Genuchten, 1987) performed the worst in all 
cases.  Likewise, Shalhevet and Hsiao (1986) concluded that the effect of water stress 
was twice that of salinity stress with an equivalent water potential, raising questions 
about the validity of an additive approach.  Homaee et al. (2002a) found their own 
multiplicative combination reduction model (2002b) performed best under almost all 
circumstances.  The combination reduction function proposed by Homaee et al. (2002b) 
is given by:

where h is the soil matric potential (cm), ho is the soil osmotic potential (cm), h4 is the 
matric potential corresponding to the permanent wilting point, h3 is the soil water 
pressure head where soil water uptake starts to be reduced, h*o is the threshold osmotic 
head where yields start to decline due to salinity, a is the relative decline in water use per 
unit of increasing salinity (% / dS m-1), and 360 is a conversion factor, to convert between 
osmotic head and dS m-1 (U.S. Salinity Lab. Staff, 1954). 
The two terms in the Homaee et al. (2002b) reduction function coincide with the 
water stress reduction factor of Feddes et al. (1976) and the salinity reduction factor of 
Maas and Hoffman (1977).  The Homaee et al. (2002b) model is very much like that of 
van Dam et al. (1997) except that the water potential corresponding to the permanent 
wilting point, h4, is increased to increase with increasing salinity by adding ho to h4.  Note 
that the Maas and Hoffman (1977) reduction function was formulated to relate soil 
salinity to relative yield, not ET or root water uptake.  However, the general form of the 
model should be valid if reductions in yield roughly parallel reductions in water uptake 
with the appropriate yield response factor (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and 
appropriate choices of the constants a and h*o (Green et al., 2006).  Homaee et al. (2002b) 
appear to apply directly the coefficients from Maas and Hoffman (1977) and cite the 
availability of these coefficients for a wide variety of crops as the main reason they chose 
this particular salinity reduction function  over others (van Genuchten, 1987; Dirksen and 
Augustijn, 1988) with harder to obtain parameters.  
From the literature cited above, it is clear that approaches exist to model root 
water uptake in response to salinity.  However, most of the hydrological models include 
only very elementary crop model routines that ignore climate, management and genetic 
factors that govern crop growth.  Castrignano et al. (1998) proposed a salinity response 
factor for the CERES-Maize model.  An empirical water/salinity stress factor was 
calculated using pre-dawn leaf water potential, replacing the standard approach of 
defining the water stress factor as the ratio of potential root water absorption to potential 
transpiration found in CERES and CROPGRO.  The authors argue that the potential root 
water absorption calculation is a very weak part of CERES.  However, their approach 
 
120
would require calibration of the water available in the soil to the pre-dawn leaf water 
potential for each crop, soil type and salinity level.  This is a difficult measure to take and 
evidence suggests that crops may regulate stomatal closure and transpiration before any 
changes in turgor or leaf water status occur (Jones, 1985; Michelena and Boyer, 1982; 
Davies and Zhang, 1991).  A second, more feasible approach is found in CropSyst.  The 
model considers solute transport in the soil water profile with a numerical solution of 
Richard’s equation and a convection equation, enabling the calculation of the soil water 
osmotic potential (Ferrer-Alegre and Stockle, 1999).  The salinity effects in the model are 
conceptually very similar to that in Homaee et al. (2002b) in that there is an empirical 
salinity reduction function and osmotic and matric potentials are added together reducing 
the total water potential gradient between soil water and root (an effect that is similar to 
changing the permanent wilting point).  The main difference is that the salinity reduction 
function used is the S-shaped curve of van Genuchten (1987) rather than the linear 
response of Mass and Hoffman (1977).   In all of the models reviewed, the assumption is 
made that salinity effects are limited to water deficit effects and no toxic ion effects are 
included. 
The goal of this research is to assess the potential of using CROPGRO as a 
planning tool in regions with soil salinity. The specific objectives were: (i) to modify the 
existing root water uptake routines to account for soil salinity; (ii) to compare the original 
and modified model in their ability to correctly predict yield and water use under saline 
conditions; and (iii) to evaluate the modified model for predicting crop growth in 
Uzbekistan under conditions of water stress by comparing simulations to field data.

CROPGRO is well documented (Jones et al., 2003; Boote et al., 1998b).  Only 
aspects related to root water uptake, water stress and the proposed salinity response factor 
are discussed below. 
A tipping bucket approach is used in CROPGRO and the DSSAT suite of crop 
models to determine water infiltration and soil moisture in successive soil layers.  Water 
drains to the next lower layer when the soil moisture is above the drained upper limit 
 
121
(equivalent to field capacity) or can be simulated as upward flow when the soil is 
saturated in layers below, depending on the soils hydraulic conductivity (Ritchie, 1998).  
Many soil – water parameters can be estimated by DSSAT based on soil texture (Ritchie, 
1998).  All water balance calculations are constrained to the user specified root zone 
depth, which is generally error prone due to measurement uncertainties.  While 
CROPGRO does not use a process oriented approach to describe soil water flow, the 
potential root water uptake term, RWUp(L), for each soil layer L, is very similar to the 
microscopic uptake term of Gardener (1964) and is given by:

where RWU(L) is in cm day-1, c1 is an empirical constant (c1 = 0.00132), c2 is an 
empirical constant (c2 = 120 – 250*LL(L)), LL(L) is the lower limit of plant available 
water corresponding with the permanent wilting point (cm3 [water] cm-3 [soil]), SW(L) is 
the actual soil water content (cm3 [water]  cm-3 [soil]), c3 is an empirical constant (c3 = 
7.01), RLV(L) is the root length density for soil layer L (cm [roots] cm-3 [soil]), 
RWUMAX is the maximum daily root water uptake per unit length of root (cm3 [water] 
cm-1 [root]), and d(L) is the depth of layer L (cm).  The total root water uptake, TRWUP, 
is the sum of all RWUp(L) for all soil layers, p. 
Actual root water uptake, TRWUP, is the minimum of potential crop transpiration, 
Eop, and potential root water uptake, RWUp(L).  Eop is the product of the reference crop 
ETo (this study used the FAO Penman – Monteith equation) and a term representing the 
fraction of the total incident solar radiation captured by the plant canopy, such that:

The original model calculates three water stress factors when the actual 
transpiration changes in relation to potential evapotranspiration.  A water stress factor, 
TURFAC, is associated with leaf turgor and reduces expansive growth, when potential 
root water uptake is less than 1.5 times the potential transpiration (Jones et al., 2003; 
Ritchie, 1998). TURFAC is computed as:

The third water stress factor acts to increase biomass partitioning to the roots 
when the ratio of actual transpiration relative to potential transpiration is less than 1 
(Hoogenboom et al., 1992). 
Modifying the CROPGRO code to simulate water uptake under conditions of soil 
salinity presented two main challenges.  Firstly, the literature indicates the superior 
performance of the macro-scale empirical reduction functions in simulating water uptake 
under saline conditions, but the CROPGRO root water uptake function employs a 
microscopic approach.  The function is designed to predict water uptake in dry soil 
conditions, as water uptake is not considered limiting under wet soil conditions.  The root 
water uptake function predicts erroneously high values of water uptake when the soil 
moisture is high (Ritchie, 1998).  This is not a problem for the model as actual water 
uptake is the minimum of potential root water uptake and potential ET.  However, this  
napproach made it impossible to implement a salinity reduction function in all but the 
driest soils.  For example, a 10% reduction in water use for an erroneously high estimate 
of water uptake is still an erroneously high value of water uptake.  Thus modifications to 
the root water uptake computations were needed to build an appropriate salinity response. 
Secondly, when the soil was dry and saline, a second reduction factor was needed 
to ensure that stomatal closure was greater under saline than non-saline conditions.  With 
the initial hypothesis that salinity effects could be modeled as only water deficit, this 
second reduction factor was not included with the result that yields increased under 
salinity if water stress was also experienced!  This unrealistic result was caused by a 
feedback of lower LAI (due to salinity) resulting in a smaller term in the denominator of 
SWFAC (eq. [5]), and therefore less photosynthetic stress.  This problem was not 
reported for the hydrological models, though they contain only very elementary crop 
 
123
growth models, and it is unclear if they considered this feedback.  This topic is elaborated 
upon in the qualitative analysis section. 
Before outlining the modifications to the CROPGRO routines, the following list 
summarizes the main assumptions and assertions of the modified model: 
? Soil salinity may vary by depth in the soil 
? Soil salinity is considered constant within the growing season 
? When soil salinity is less than the crop tolerance, root water uptake will be 
determined by the original CROPGRO routines 
? Soil salinity should reduce plant water uptake from a potential uptake by an 
amount equivalent to a reduction function dependent on soil salinity (SALT(L)) 
and crop characteristics of tolerance (ECthreshold) and relative reduction rate 
(SALRDCT) 
? Soil salinity will not reduce plant growth when the soil is very moist, i.e. 
TRWUP > 1.5 Eop 
? When the soil is moist, potential root water uptake in each layer will be defined 
by the potential rate of ET, Eop, multiplied by the proportion of the total water 
uptake from that layer 
? When the soil is dry, the original CROPGRO routine will be used to simulate 
potential root water uptake, as it has been designed for these conditions 
? At any given soil water content, saline conditions should result in greater 
stomatal closure and reductions in photosynthesis than non-saline conditions.  
This implies that salinity should cause SWFAC to be less than (or at least 
equal to) SWFAC under non-saline conditions, all other factors being equal 
? The salinity routines are tested using saline soils dominated by gypsum salts, 
though it is expected to work for all low to moderately saline soils with 
appropriate parameterization  
 
Therefore, for conditions of soil salinity, an iterative routine was implemented 
that replaced LL(L) with a new value LLsalt(L) for the calculation of RWU(L).  It is 
important to note that LLsalt(L) was not passed to any other routines in CROPGRO. The 
first step was to calculate RWU(L) and TRWUP using the original model.  This initial 
 
124
calculation was used to (1) determine if soil water or Eop limited water uptake and (2) to 
determine the proportion of water uptake from each layer, PWU(L). PWU(L) was 
calculated as:

[6] 
where RWUprevious(L) and TRWUPprevious indicates the previous values of these variable 
are used to determine the proportion, which is then used to determine new estimates of 
RWU(L) and TRWUP.   
In wet soils, actual TRWUP is set equal to potential ET, Eop, so LLsalt(L) was 
calculated as follows:

Using LLsalt(L) new estimates of C2(L), RWU(L), and TRWUP were calculated.  If the 
new value of TRWUP was within 0.1 mm of ETreduced, the process terminated.  Otherwise, 
the calculation was repeated beginning with an updated value of PWU(L).  The process 
usually converged after two to three iterations.  
 
In dry soils, the same iterative process was used except that a value of LLsalt(L) 
that would result in values of RWU(L) that would sum to the original model’s estimate of 
potential root water uptake, TRWUPo, multiplied by the salinity response function was 
required, such that:

MODEL EVALUATION 
 
6.3.1 Qualitative analysis 
Having built the salinity response into CROPGRO a number of hypothetical 
simulations were run to see if the model could capture the general trends in yield and 
water use expected with increasing soil salinity.  As in the analysis of Ferrer-Alegre and 
Stockle (1999), the model response to different levels of deficit irrigation, atmospheric 
evaporative demand and cultivar salinity tolerance was evaluated, all of which are 
reported to change the response to salinity for specific crops (Francois and Maas, 1999).  
These factors were tested using the common bean cultivar and climatic conditions used 
for the  greenhouse study reported in Chapter 5.  As the baseline conditions, an 
evaporative demand equivalent to that used in the greenhouse study was selected to 
mimic the field conditions in the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan in the mid to late summer.  
The default level of deficit irrigation corresponded to a 50% depletion of the readily 
available water.  The default crop values are a salinity threshold of 4.8 dS m-1 as 
determined for this cultivar of common bean in gypsiferous soil with a reduction factor of 
5%/dS m-1.  For the simulation, varying the level of deficit irrigation between depletion 
factors of 30 and 80% was selected.  The VPD was varied from the value estimated for 
the greenhouse by 20% greater than and less than that value.  A salt sensitive common 
bean crop (in gypsiferous soil) was estimated to have a salinity threshold of 3 dS m-1 and 
a relative reduction rate of 10%/ dS m-1 and the tolerant cultivar a threshold of 6 dS m-1 
 
126
and a relative reduction rate of 3.5%/dS m-1.  Six levels of soil salinity were simulated, 
ranging from 2.8 dS m-1 (corresponding to gypsum salts only) to 15 dS m-1. 
The results of these simulations, for yield and water consumption, are shown in 
Figs. 6.2 and 6.3, respectively.  In these two figures, yield and water consumption are 
expressed relative to the 2.8 dS m-1 salinity level and the (a) 30% depletion factor, (b) 
typical VPD, and (c) average crop salinity tolerance.  The model is responsive to soil 
salinity under various levels of deficit irrigation.  The effects of soil salinity are less 
severe in humid conditions and greater yield reductions are expected with higher VPDs 
(Francois and Maas, 1999).  Finally, different crop tolerances for salinity are captured 
with changes in the threshold salinity level and the relative reduction factor.  In all cases, 
the relative reductions in final yield are greater than the corresponding reductions in 
water use.  This highlights the discrepancy between the threshold and relative reduction 
coefficients of the Maas and Hoffman (1977) reduction function for yield being applied 
directly in the proposed reduction function for salinity, as appears to have been the case 
with Homaee et al. (2002b).  For the simulations, values obtained in a greenhouse trial 
with the cultivar under consideration were used.  However, Allen et al. (1998) combine 
the yield response to water stress factor, Ky, of Doorenbos and Kassam (1979) with the 
Maas and Hoffman salinity yield reduction function, B, to obtain an “effective” relative 
water use reduction factor, b, calculated as 
y

[4] 
This may be a good first approximation to be included as a species default in the 
CROPGRO models.  However, for this common bean cultivar grown in a gypsiferous 
soil, the value of b obtained from equation [4] (b = 19% (dS m-1)-1 /1.15 = 16.5 % (dS m-
1)-1) was more than three times higher than the value of b obtained in the greenhouse trial 
and found to work well in the model.

The need for the second reduction factor acting on SWFAC is explained by 
considering case (a) in which different levels of deficit irrigation are employed.  In the 
case with frequent irrigations (p = 30%) when soil moisture does not limit transpiration, 
reductions in yield and water uptake are affected.  Likewise, when the irrigations were 
simulated less frequently, yield and water use were also reduced though by greater 
amounts.  This approximately accurate representation of reality was only achieved in the 
model with the addition of the factor promoting stomatal closure.  When this factor was 
not included, and the only effect of salinity was to reduce water uptake the simulations 
actually predicted increased yield with salinity if deficit irrigation was practiced.  This is 
explained by the effect of water uptake (and salinity) on leaf expansion rates.  Under 
water stress, leaf area is reduced and the plant loses less water.  Under this condition, 
salinity was acting as a drought avoidance mechanism.  Stomatal closure is simulated in 
the term SWFAC.  This term was actually increasing with salinity and deficit irrigation, 
as the reductions in root water uptake were less than the reductions in potential 
transpiration, as this term is very much a function of leaf area. 
 
6.3.2 Quantitative Analysis 
Two experiments and a third ‘quasi-quantitative’ approach were used to evaluate 
the model performance.  The first experiment used was conducted in a greenhouse on the 
Macdonald Campus of McGill University, Montreal, Canada during the spring and 
summer of 2007; the full details of this experiment are presented in Chapter 5 of this 
thesis..  In this experiment, soil salinity and deficit irrigation level comprised the main 
treatments to determine the crop response to increasing salinity in a soil dominated by 
gypsum salts.  An Uzbek variety of common bean was grown in large soil bins measuring 
43 cm wide by 74 cm long by 50 cm deep, at an initial density of 20 plants per box.  The 
boxes, which were drained along their length by 5 mm perforated drain pipe, were filled 
with a Soulanges fine sandy loam soil (67% sand; 20% silt; and 13% clay).  Gypsum 
(CaSO4·2H2O) and NaCl were added to the boxes with a small portable cement mixer to 
give ECe values of  2.8 dS m-1 (no NaCl), 5.4 dS m-1(low NaCl) and 7.5 dS m-1 (high 
NaCl).  The boxes were irrigated with one of three levels of deficit irrigation, roughly 
corresponding to depletion levels of  45%, 60% and 70%.  The greenhouse temperature 
 
131
was 32°C during the day and 20°C at night with the photoperiod set at 14 hours per day.  
The entire experiment was conducted twice. 
The second experiment was conducted in the the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan 
during the summers of 2003 and 2004.  This experiment was designed to determine the 
crop response of a local variety of common bean to deficit irrigation and alternate furrow 
irrigation grown as a second crop after winter wheat harvest.  The same seed stock was 
used in both greenhouse and field experiments.  The soil type ranged between a sandy 
loam and silt loam.  Each plot measured 15 by 15 m and contained 23 furrows 12 m in 
length, and was replicated four times. Deficit irrigation levels were the same as in the 
previous experiment.  A weather station in an adjacent field measured daily minimum 
and maximum temperature and relative humidity, wind speed at 2m, and precipitation.  
Soil moisture was measured gravimetrically at the soil surface, 10 and 20 cm, and with a 
neutron probe at 40 and 60 cm two days before and two days after irrigating and every 5 
to 7 days to calculate the water balance and determine crop consumptive use.  Full 
experimental details are in Chapter 3 (Webber et al., 2006) and Chapter 4 of this thesis. 
In both experiments, destructive samples were taken four times during the growing 
period from 2 plants per plot to determine different components of above ground biomass 
and leaf area.  Seed harvest was conducted at physiological maturity to determine the 
various yield components and threshing percentage. 
 
The third, ‘quasi-quantitative’, analysis was performed using the greenhouse 
salinity trials and data, with one exception.  Rather than using exact irrigation amounts as 
an input, the simulation control was set to automatic irrigation for the average depletion 
levels obtained in the greenhouse trial.  This depletion was adjusted to get the correct 
number and timing of irrigations that had been applied in the real trials, with as close as 
possible to the same irrigation water volume applied.  This removes the effect of  
irrigation volume from the comparison of the two models. 
 
Initial model calibration for the cultivar traits was performed with the non-saline 
treatments (three levels of deficit irrigation) in the first greenhouse trial following the 
methodology outlined by the model developers (Boote, 1999).  Validation for the non-
saline treatments was performed with the same treatments from the second greenhouse 
trial.  Since all of the soil bins contained gypsum (as does all of the soil in the region 
 
132
studied in the Fergana Valley), any osmotic effects due to the gypsum will only appear in 
the soil fertility factor (SLPF).  This factor is used to describe reductions in 
photosynthesis due to any soil nutrient deficiencies other than nitrogen (Boote et al., 
2001).  Calibration for the salinity response was performed using all nine treatments 
(three salt levels and three levels of deficit irrigation) from the first greenhouse trial.  
Model validation was performed with the second trial from the greenhouse and the two 
field experiments from Uzbekistan.  The ‘quasi-quantitative’ analysis is used to compare 
the original and modified models. 
 
The evaluation criteria used were: the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean 
absolute error (MAE), the relative error (RE) and the Willmott (1981) agreement index 
(i).  All measures are defined in Wallach (2006), and when used in combination with 
graphical representation of the simulated and observed variables, provided sound 
evidence for evaluating and modifying models (Wallach, 2006; Willmott, 1981). 
 
6.4 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
6.4.1. Calibration and validation of cultivar data 
The cultivar traits obtained in the calibration routine were all within the range of 
values listed for other cultivars and are summarized together with the soil fertility factor 
and parameters related to the new salinity response in Table 6.1.  The measures of 
agreement for the cultivar calibration are listed in Table 6.2.  The units of agreement all 
indicate a good initial calibration of the model for cultivar traits with no imposed salinity 
stress.  The predicted above ground biomass was considerably lower than the observed 
values during the validation simulations.  The model was calibrated with data collected 
under spring growing conditions, whereas the validation data set was from the summer.  
One of two possibilities is suspected.  Either the original model is not adequately 
sensitive to changing photoperiods, or the additional staking of the plants during the 
summer experiment due to the longer day lengths lessened the degree of senescence.

6.4.2. Calibration and validation of the new salinity response factor 
Calibration of the salinity response function required tuning of the four new 
parameters.  The values obtained are given in Table 6.1.  The values of ECthreshold and 
SALRDCT (the relative reduction coefficient) did not need to be changed from the initial 
 
134
starting values obtained in the greenhouse.  This was largely a result of the way the 
modified program was designed.  The real calibration exercise was with the two 
parameters, S1 and S2, which control the degree of stomatal closure due only to salinity- 
independent of water deficit.  The fit was generally very good for yield and seasonal ET 
for both calibration and validation data sets as shown by the measures of agreement in 
Table 6.3 and Fig. 6.4.  For comparison, the measures of agreement for the original 
model are also included.  At first glance, the results are puzzling and it may appear that 
the original model was also responsive to salinity, as the two versions perform equally 
well for yield and water use.  However, this is an artifact of the experimental design, 
which determined the response to soil salinity.  In this experiment, all treatments with the 
same level of deficit irrigation were irrigated on the same day (i.e. no NaCl, depletion i; 
low NaCl, depletion i; and high NaCl, depletion i, where i is the level of deficit 
irrigation).  The day before irrigating, soil moisture was measured in all salt treatments 
(at that level of deficit irrigation) to determine the actual soil moisture deficit and 
irrigations needed to bring the treatment soil moisture back to field capacity.  In almost 
all cases, the salt treated plants used less water, and therefore needed smaller irrigations, 
to return their soil moisture to field capacity.  Therefore, the original model’s apparent 
responsiveness to salinity is actually responsiveness to irrigation amount.  To ensure the 
modified model is responsive to the salinity, which results in reduced water uptake and 
stomatal closure, and not simply irrigation amount the qualitative analysis and the ‘quasi-
quantitative’ simulation were performed.  The results of this simulation are presented in 
Table 6.4 and Fig. 6.5.  When the effect of irrigation amount has been removed the 
original model was not sensitive to salinity while the modified model predicted crop 
growth very well, with the exception of the biomass for the validation set.

nodule number to be calibrated.  The nodule number and effectiveness are two 
parameters that strongly influence growth of legumes in the CROPGRO model as they 
act as estimators of nitrogen availability. This was performed with the treatments with no 
water stress (depletion 45%, conventional and alternate furrow irrigation).  Individual 
plots were treated as individual observations, as significant block effects existed for soil 
type and planting date.  The model agreement is considered fair for yield and water use.  
Model calibration was complicated because of uncertainty in both the soil fertility and 
nodule number parameters.  Both of these factors have a strong influence on biomass 
production, which was poorly predicted.  In a sensitivity analysis, 10% increases in the 
nodule number and the soil fertility factor produced 6 and 8% increases in yield, whereas 
20% increases in these values produced 10 and 15% increases in yield.  By contrast, yield 
was much less sensitive to the two new parameters controlling the salinity stomatal 
response, S1 and S2.  When S1 was increased by 10 and 20%, yield increased by less than 
1%.  Yield decreased by 2 and 5% when S2 was increased by these same amounts.  This 
difficulty could be overcome by either (1) evaluating a crop that is well nodulated and 
assuming the nodule number and effectiveness was a maximum or  (2) by testing the 
model with a non-nitrogen fixing crop to obtain a good estimate of the soil fertility factor.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
Crop models offer farmers and planners a safe and inexpensive method of 
evaluating different cropping systems and strategies.  The CROPGRO model was 
 
140
selected as it is sufficiently responsive to crop physiology and a number of agronomic 
inputs to be of interest for application to crop growth responses to irrigation technologies 
in the Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan. Of particular interest are legume crops that could be 
grown after winter wheat harvest and offer rural people an opportunity to improve their 
food security.  However, the current model is not sensitive to soil salinity and thus limits 
its applicability in the region.  A salinity response function was successfully added a 
CROPGRO that correctly predicts yield and water use over a range of salinities, 
atmospheric conditions, levels of deficit irrigation and crop tolerances.  The model was 
developed using data from soils dominated by gypsum salts, and thus the hypothesis that 
osmotic effects dominate was considered valid.  The model’s ability to correctly predict 
biomass under saline and water stressed conditions was less successful, though it 
performed as well as the original model.  The model performed well for the conditions of 
the Fergana Valley.

CHAPTER 7: GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
 
7.1 GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The goal of this research was to investigate methods optimizing irrigation water 
use to improve food security for rural people living the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan.  
While farmers have limited access to many resources, their obligation to produce the state 
ordered cotton and wheat and the lack of water are the most serious constraints to 
increasing food production.  This study proposed cultivating short season food legumes in 
the late summer following winter wheat harvest, using water saving irrigation techniques, 
as a method to overcome these limitations.  Crop growth modeling is proposed to be an 
effective and inexpensive way for farmers and planners to evaluate alternate cropping 
systems and technologies. 
A field study in the Fergana Valley determined the water use efficiency of two 
legume crops irrigated with both deficit irrigation and alternate furrow irrigation.  The 
study considered a number of parameters related to water use in a comparison of the 
response of the two crops to water stress to highlight the factors that lead to water savings 
while maintaining yields.  A greenhouse study investigated the growth response of the 
same two legumes to soil salinity when irrigated with deficit irrigation in simulated 
gypsiferous soils typical of the region.  The study was unique in that the literature on crop 
tolerance to salinity is generally not valid in these soils.  Finally, a salinity response 
function was added to the crop growth model, CROPGRO, to enable its use in the 
Fergana Valley. 
The field experiment revealed that both common bean and green gram can be 
successfully grown as second crops after winter wheat harvest in the region.  
Implementing alternate furrow and deficit irrigation enable considerable water savings to 
be realized.  Use of alternate furrow irrigation produced water savings of 9 to 15% in 
crop consumptive use and by as much as 25% of the irrigation water applied; rainfall 
during the winter can replenish the soil profile accounting for the difference.  Water 
savings with deficit irrigation were highly dependent on the crop.  In green gram, average 
 
142
water savings of 33% were realized compared to an average of 12% for common bean.  
Likewise, under both techniques water use efficiency increased for green gram with 
increasing water stress whereas it was constant for common bean. 
Patterns of root water extraction were markedly different between the crops when 
deficit irrigation was implemented.  For common bean, treatments irrigated with deficit 
irrigation used less water than the control at depths 0 – 40 cm.  However, at 60 cm depth, 
the stressed treatments extracted more water than the control.  Conversely, for green 
gram, treatments irrigated with deficit irrigation used less water at all depths in the 
profile.  This evidence, together with root biomass data, suggests that in response to water 
stress, common bean increases partitioning of assimilated carbon stores to root 
production to extract more water deeper in the soil profile.  The result is that water 
savings are minimal as transpiration rates remain high and seed yield is decreased as root 
biomass increases.  Green gram seems to employ a very different strategy including 
reduced root biomass and transpiration rates resulting in decreased water use at all depths 
in the soil. 
Strategies to increase food production and reduce agricultural water use must be 
developed within the context of increasing land degradation due to salinization.  Much of 
the available literature on crop salinity tolerance is not valid for the region’s soils because 
of the large amounts of gypsum salts.  For common bean and green gram, acceptable 
yields were attained at the highest level of salinization (ECe of 7.5 dS m-1).  Biomass and 
leaf area accumulation were reduced by approximately 20% as the salinity was increased 
from 2.8 to 7.5 dS m-1, which is considerably less than expected from the literature.  
These results indicate that in gypsiferous soils, not only is the yield reduction threshold 
higher, but the rate of yield decline with increasing salinity is less severe than in soils 
dominated by sodium and chloride salts.  Finally, no interactions were found to exist 
between the application of reduced deficit irrigation and the degree of land salinization. 
In an effort to make these finding more general and accessible, a commonly used 
crop growth model, CROPGRO, was modified and tested for use in the region. The root 
water uptake routine of the CROPGRO model was modified to account for the effects of 
soil salinity on water use and growth.  The original hypothesis considered the only effect 
of salinity to be one of water deficit, as is common in most hydrological models.  
 
143
However, unexpected results under conditions of combined dry  and saline soil 
necessitated the addition of a second factor to reduce photosynthesis, mimicking stomatal 
closure under these conditions.  It is unclear whether the hydrological models would have 
detected this error as they typically employ only statistical crop growth models.  The 
modified CROPGRO model includes an iterative process that enabled an approach very 
similar to the empirical reduction functions.  A qualitative analysis of the model indicated 
that the model performed as expected under a range of atmospheric, irrigation and crop 
tolerance scenarios.  The Willmott agreement index, root mean square error, mean 
absolute error and relative error were employed to evaluate the model.  The modified 
model performance was excellent for yield and ET when evaluated for the greenhouse 
study.  The modified model was successfully tested with field data on common bean 
(Phaseolus vulgraris) from the experiment in the Fergana Valley, though the sensitivity 
of the model to a soil fertility function and relative nodule number made it difficult to 
assess the model performance. 
 
 
7.2 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH 
 
This study investigated different aspects of improving irrigated food production in 
the Fergana Valley.  There are several areas where further research is needed: 
 
1 Develop a methodology for scheduling alternate furrow irrigations.  This 
investigation showed the water saving ability of the technique, though scheduling 
was done relative to the conventional furrow irrigation strategy.  Specifically, the 
study could investigation whether the use of the soil moisture in a dry furrow, wet 
furrow or an average of the two would be most appropriate. 
2 Test the hypothesis that salinity effects in gypsiferous soils are due to water deficit 
effects by conducting the salinity response experiments reported in this thesis 
using weighing lysimeters to determine daily ET rates. 
3 Evaluate the seasonal and longer term impact of the proposed cropping systems 
on soil salinity and water table depths.  This study would involve the 
 
144
parameterization of a two dimensional water and solute transport model.  
Currently, heavy irrigations are applied at the beginning of each year for leaching 
salts from the root zone, though this practice accelerates soil salinization by 
raising the water table. 
4 Compare the water use and yield of plants in soils at equivalent values of soil 
salinity in soils with and without gypsum to enable the transfer of the coefficients 
of Maas and Hoffman (1977) to (1) soils containing gypsum and (2) the empirical 
salinity reductions functions for predicting root water uptake 
5 Evaluate the salinity response function in the modified CROPGRO model for 
other crops currently modeled with CROPGRO 
6 Evaluate the salinity response function in the modified CROPGRO model for soils 
in which the dominate salt is not gypsum.  The modified model is expected to be 
valid under all conditions of low to moderate soil salinity for short season crops.  
However, if the toxic salt effects are found to be non-negligible, a factor to speed 
senescence could be implemented. 
7 Adapt CROPGRO to model green gram.  The work conducted for this thesis has 
amassed a great deal of data on the crop response to water deficit and salinity 
response that could be used in testing the model.  However, to construct a species 
file for the model, experiments should be conducted using different cultivars and 
in a variety of environments. 
 
 
7.3. 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE 
 
The work presented in this thesis provides original contributions to the body of 
knowledge concerning irrigated legume production under conditions of soil salinity.  
Specifically: 
 
? Green gram was shown to offer considerable water savings and high water use 
efficiency when irrigated with alternate furrow and deficit irrigation using a 
 
145
depletion factor of at least 65% when grown as a second crop in the Fergana 
Valley.  
 
? Green gram increased water use efficiency with deficit irrigation and alternate 
furrow irrigation by reducing root growth and soil water extraction.  Water use 
efficiency in common bean was constant when either technology was 
implemented as the crop increased root biomass to access water deeper in the 
soil profile, evidently at the expense of seed yield.  
 
? The salinity tolerance of common bean in a simulated gypsiferous soil was found 
to equal 4.8 dS m-1 and the relative rate of reduction in water use 4.6%/dSm-1.  
The salinity tolerance of green gram in a simulated gypsiferous soil was found to 
be 2.8 dS m-1 and the relative rate of reduction in water use 3.5%/dSm-1. 
 
? A salinity response function was incorporated into the CROPGRO model.  The 
modifications to the model were designed to predict crop growth in response to 
low to moderate soil salinity.  The model performance was verified in a qualitative 
analysis under conditions of increasing salinity for scenarios with variable climate, 
water stress and crop characteristics and in a quantitative comparison of simulated and 
measured greenhouse and field results.
